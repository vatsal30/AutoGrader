1	1	1	1	some addit inform that we would need to replic the experi is how much vinegar should be place in each ident contain how or what tool to us to measur the mass of the four differ sampl and how much distil water to us to rins the four sampl after take them out of the vinegar .
2	1	1	1	after read the experi i realiz that the addit inform you need to replic the experi is on the amount of vinegar you pour in each contain two label the contain befor you start war experi and three write a conclus to make sure war result ar accur .
3	1	1	1	what you need is more trial a control set up and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup beaker . you could also take and check the mass everi min or hour .
4	1	0	0	the student should list what rock is better and what rock is the wors in the procedur .
5	1	2	2	for the student to be abl to make a replic thei would need to tell us how much vinegar is us and what type of materi is need for the experi .
6	1	1	0	i would need the inform of why you would let the differ sampl dry out of the contain . and what ar thei dry into
7	1	1	0	the inform i would need in order to successfulli replic the experi is the correct measur thei us for the experi also the materi that wa us to treat the experi . after the hour of remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . make it dry for minut might not be long enough to realli determin the mass of each sampl especi when you have more than on differ sampl to do with differ textur .
8	1	3	3	you would need mani more piec of inform to replic the experi . you would need the type of sampl to begin with in the procedur . you would also need to know the amount of vinegar us in each contain . you would also need to know exactli how to mass the sampl and what type of contain to us plastic for exampl might alter the result .
9	1	3	3	some addit inform you will need ar the materi . you also need to know the size of the contain to measur how the acid rain effect it . you need to know how much vinegar is us for each sampl . anoth thing that would help is to know how big the sampl stone ar by measur the best possibl wai .
10	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi we will need to add inform such as st iclenx statement of what the four sampl ar and how mani piec you will need as well as the amount of vinegar bring pour into the contain and the instrument you will need to retriev when determin mass . howev revis of sentenc and genuin ring will be requir .
11	1	0	0	an addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi
12	1	3	3	the addit inform you would need to replic the experi would includ the size of the sampl . also you would need to know the kind of vinegar . in a addit it is crucial to get the same type and size contain .
13	1	2	2	there ar two piec of addit inform necessari to replic the experi . first of all the procedur doe not offici specifi what the four sampl ar . also the procedur doe not specifi how much vinegar to pour for each contain . a good procedur would have specifi thi
14	1	2	2	in order the replic the experi you need
15	1	0	0	well what i understand about thi procedur is that you take four sampl put them in differ contain that look the same put vinegar on everi sampl final rins them out with normal water let them sit for minut till thei dry . then your final go to see the differ between those sampl .
16	1	0	0	i don t know what is go on
17	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know the shape of each materi becaus the amount of surfac area expand to the vinegar mass chang the result . i would also need to know how much vinegar and what size contain to us in order to exactli replic the experi .
18	1	0	0	the addit inform i would need is to come up with an hypothesi to predict which sampl will have the highest mass in acid rain . after that i will have to come up with my depend and independ variabl so i can tell and see each on is differ in mass . i will organ the data to see if the inform is accur . then i will write the conclus to see if my hypothesi wa correct and to see if my result were correct .
19	1	0	0	in order to replic thi experi i would need a scare in order to get the mass . next i would need tape and marker to label the contain . last i would need all sampl and graduat cylind as a contain to replic thi experi .
20	1	3	3	in order for the me to replic their procedur i would need to know what four sampl thei us thei should includ that in their procedur . also thei should stai where you ar to put the four contain dure the hour time period final thei should includ what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do thi experi i would in as close to what thei actual did and therefor would be abl to replic the experi .
21	1	0	0	you would need to have four separ but ident contain . you would also need to pour in each of them vinegar to determin the mass of the item be place in them . and new item would be need to be place in each of the contain .
22	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the mass of the four differ sampl how much vinegar to pour into the contain what the sampl were made up of and how much water to rins them with after the hour .
23	1	0	0	the student data need to includ how much of the solut wa pour . thei also need to find out if the rock weigh the same when thei start .
24	1	3	3	for thi experi duplic you would need to know exactli how much vinegar wa us in each cup . you would also have to know how big in size each contain wa . addition you would need to know the size of each sampl to assur that you could place them in the cup evenli .
25	1	1	1	some addit inform that i would need is the amount of vinegar thei pour .
26	1	2	2	after read the group procedur i would need to know what type of vinegar thei were us becaus it could of been ani type what wa the measur of contain becaus the contain could have been differ size and thei wouldn t have valid result and thei also should have told me what thei were hold constant becaus i wouldn t know what variabl to us or control .
27	1	2	2	thei need to includ what time thei start and when thei end . also the amount of vinegar thei us . also the size of each sampl .
28	1	0	0	. get differ sampl marbl limeston wood plastic . p . put each sampl into differ contain . p . pour vinegar in each of separ but ident contain . p . after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each w distil water . p . allow sampl to sit and dry for min . p . determin the data of each sampl . p . record your data .
29	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know what the sampl were . in thi group s procedur thei do not state what
30	1	2	0	in step three you would need to know how much of each sampl to us . also in step to you need to fill each contain with the same amount step you must rins each stone as much . also there is no control variabl .
31	1	2	2	i addit inform that i would need to replic the experi is to add where your go to leav the sampl for hour . anoth on that thei would need to add in order for me to replic the experi is to clearli state the independ variabl . i would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each separ but ident contain .
32	1	0	0	you will need a timer to determin the time that the vinegar dri up .
33	1	3	3	for thi experi you would actual need to know what each sampl is the amount of vinegar that wa us and the size of each sampl
34	1	3	3	to replic the experi i would need to know the sampl that i will be us . i would also need to know how much vinegar to us . i would also need to know what type of contain to us .
35	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi . you would need to know how much vinegar to pour you need to know how much distil water and you as need to know how your go to weigh it .
36	1	2	2	well i would need to know what the problem statement is . i would need to know what type of cup we ar us . i would need to know the amount of vinegar we ar us . and i would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ .
37	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much of each materi is us befor i go and find the mass . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each materi . although thei show the materi in the data take thei should still list them in the procedur .
38	1	0	0	i will need to know what s the purpos for thi experi know the differ in mass for each sampl and i need to know an estim of what thei thought the start and end mass wa .
39	1	1	1	thei should add how much vinegar to add to each sampl . for thi lab to be more accur thei should have also ad more trial as well as ad a constant variabl such as a rock in just water .
40	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know first how to calcul the mass of the sampl . i would also need t o know what the four sampl ar as if is not state in the procedur . lastli to repeat thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar wa place into each contain .
41	1	1	1	addit inform that would be need to replic the data would be what equip is need for the experi what materi ar go to be us and how much of each materi will be us
42	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the contain . you also need to know what to be of contain to pour the vinegar in . also you need to know how much or how long to rins the sampl with distil water .
43	1	3	3	after read the procedur i would first need to know what the for sampl ar that i am test second i p would need to know how much vinegar put in each contain next the procedur should tell me how thing to case rins each sampl in distil water .
44	1	3	3	determin what the differ sampl ar then state how much vinegar you would be ad to each sampl . state how long you ar rise the materi in water . ex minut
45	1	2	2	in order to replic the group experi i would need a lot of addit inform . first of all i would need to know what it is that thei ar us as the four sampl rock bark
46	1	0	0	i think the experi should make the descript more specif so as not to be confus and mistak cup . for instanc thei could sai each of the cork sampl and place sampl into cup label a
47	1	2	2	on extra thing that need to be includ is what materi or object the four sampl ar of anoth thing not includ is the amount of vinegar need to put in each contain . the word a sampl doesn t specifi the exact amount of each rock ar need . a repetit of thi experi is need to verifi the result .
48	1	0	0	there could be more than test for each sampl . there could also have a constant ad to the experi . also there ar to softi in teach in the experi like put on goggl befor ey where glove when touch the vinegar
49	1	0	0	thei should take more note that wai in case thei mess up thei can have a the inform how to redo it .
50	1	3	2	how much vinegar should you pour with what label and when to sit it it stand dry for min . . . label . the contain s repeatedli separ but ident contain . what contain should we us
51	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what the differ materi were . i would also need to know how mani differ materi there were and what the start mass of each materi wa .
52	1	0	0	in the experi i would determin the ma of each sampl pair the vinegar into a contain then label . i would wait hour then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water . let the sampl dry and find the mass differ
53	1	2	2	in order to complet thi experi three addit thing should be includ . the first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup . the second is to list the far sampl in the procedur . the third is to record the inform obtain .
54	1	2	2	in order to replic the group s i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long contain how much the sampl you need to add you need to rins the sampl .
55	1	2	2	the procedur need to state the four type of sampl it is us marbl limeston wood plastic . you need to determin how much vinegar you ar pour into each cup . you need a set amount . you could also do the time at differ time . so you could do it at is at and at minut to see if there is a chang at all in the mass over time .
56	1	1	0	the inform i would need to replic the experi is the four differ sampl the four ident contain the amount of time to let the sampl sit and the product to rins the sampl with so i could let them sit for more .
57	1	0	0	to repeat thi experi you would need to get the averag that wa us in the last procedur and let it sit for twenti eight hour instead of twenti four then rins and record the chang in mass .
58	1	2	2	we need to know the exact amount of vinegar go into each contain to make sure that each sampl fair result . we also need to have a set start mass so all of the sampl have the same amount or the result will not be reliabl . we also need to know what kind and how big the contain ar becaus result mai be unreli if the contain for the sampl have all differ volum and shape .
59	1	3	3	some addit inform that you would need is how mani vinegar ar you pour in . also in step it sai add a sampl of each materi . we need to know how big the sampl would have to be . someth that could effect the data could be what temperatur ar you put thi experi in is it room temperatur we need to know thi .
60	1	3	3	to replic the experi the procedur would requir more detail . on piec of inform that is omit is the amount of vinegar us in the experi . it is also import to know what temperatur the experi wa kept at dure the hour . final the procedur need to includ detail about the experi for exampl if the whole sampl must be submerg .
61	1	1	1	you would need the amount of vinegar be pour into each of the cap . that becaus the experi onli tell you to pour vinegar but when peopl read if thei might not know how much vinegar to put .
62	1	3	3	thi group left same veri import thing out of their procedur . first of all thei didn t tell us what sampl to us for the experi . thei didn t tell us how much vinegar to us or what size contain we would need all of thi inform to replic thi lab .
63	1	1	1	you would need the name of the four sampl you ar us to make a tabl to record data . write down you need to record the start mass end mass and differ in mass .
64	1	0	0	some addit inform i would need is how thei found the mass and what type of instrument wa be us . also when thei sai place a sampl of the materi how much of each type am i go to need .
65	1	0	0	first of all you ll need to measur the contain bit ls and subtract it from weight of the sampl so you don t accid have extra weight . calcul the time differ it took to prepar them . us the same weight of each sampl .
66	1	0	0	to exactli replic thi experi you would have to know how thei measur the mass of the object becaus without that how would we figur out the differ mass . we have to know the start mass the end mass and the differ in mass .
67	1	1	1	after read the group procedur i did not know how much vinegar thei would be pour into the contain . thi group also did not state the start time at which thei ad the vinegar . thi group also did not state the reason the data thei just said to determin it .
68	1	2	2	i would need the amount of rich in each contain . i would need the amount of vinegar of r contain . i would need the same kind of vinegar in each contain . i would need all of thi addit inform to replic thi reprimand . i would also need the amount trial done .
69	1	3	3	. a list of materi and safeti requir . p . the amount of vinegar to put in the contain . p . the temperatur of the room vinegar p . a control group .
70	1	1	1	addit inform you need in order to replic thi experi is a control group . a control grai should have no effect on the sampl and is need so you can base your answer off reliabl sourc . also in order to replic thi experi we need to know the amount of vinegar we ar put on the sampl . we also would need to know .
71	1	1	1	what you would need is the inform on how much vinegar is ad to everi sampl . for exampl on sampl can be in a differ amount of vinegar . so that can throw their end mass off .
72	1	2	2	we would need to know what sampl thei us for the experi thei just sai sampl . we need to know how much vinegar thei pour into each cup and we would need to know what unit to measur the mass of the sampl with . thei would have to specifi that we should weigh them us gram .
73	1	0	0	what the group of student did wa determin the mass of differ sampl . so what i would do what thei did in the begin or the investig i would us the sampl and do anoth experi with the sampl .
74	1	1	1	on statement thei need to put the measur of the contain p on stamen how much water p on number what the measur mt were support to us for the mass .
75	1	1	1	some addit inform for their procedur would be to us the same amount of vinegar for each contain . also make sure the time ar all on for each sampl . also measur the mass after it dry and find your differ from it start mass .
76	1	3	3	in order to replic ta experi a person would need to know a few more thing . thei would need to know which substanc to us how much of each on . the person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain . thei would also need to know what temperatur to put ta contain in . on might also want to know what type of contain how to write down the find .
77	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar wa place in the contain . what type of sampl you were measur and place in the contain and the temperatur at which thei were store at to ensur equal experi .
78	1	0	0	addit piec of inform that should be includ in the procedur would be with with what would you be us to determin the mass such as a scale have the control variabl evid in the procedur on last thing that should be to move a tabl of the start mass the end mass and the differ in mass us gram .
79	1	1	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know how mani ml of vinegar is pour into each contain . you would also need to know how much distil water wa suppos to be pour onto the sampl . also you mai want to have the start mass of each sampl be the same .
80	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know more thing that weren t state in the procedur . i would need to know the amount of vinegar pour into the contain the amount of time the sampl were in the vinegar and the amount of distil water us to rins it off .
81	1	3	3	the addit thing that i would put ar the procedur in what find at temperatur thei left the contain in . i would also includ the sampl of what i am test in the experi . lastli i would also put in my procedur how much amount of vinegar thei ar put in .
82	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you must be abl to know what the four materi ar how to measur the mass how much vinegar should be pour into the contain and how much distil water should thei rins it with . thei should start by sai d determin the mass put the tripl beam balanc of the four riff . sampl name them then pour vinegar how much into contain then these step of step wash how much distil water and it would be better .
83	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the size of the contain that you would place the sampl in you would need to know the amount of vinegar put in each contain you would need to know what to us to measur out the mass for exampl tripl beam balanc etc and you would also need to know the materi to us to place each sampl in the contain .
84	1	0	0	you got to put more vinegar in wood so it make no differ in mass in plastic out a littl not more vinegar so it could do more reaction .
85	1	1	1	anoth trial the amount of vinegar us and no chang of time to make sure it s accur . becaus if not quill chang the experi . by chang the most import thing .
86	1	3	3	to replic thi experi on must know inform that is not given by the procedur . first we must know how much vinegar to put into the contain enough to cover them next we need to know how the vinegar will affect the materi . will we complet submerg it or onli partial final we need to know which materi to us . the data indic them but the procedur doe not .
87	1	0	0	three addit piec of inform i would need to replic the procedur ar to gather materi us a control and when it s finish to record the data .
88	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know sever more piec of inform . on of them be the amount of each materi wood plastic marbl and limeston . you would also need to know how much vinegar to add . final a constant for each materi would also help .
89	1	0	0	the independ variabl is the marbl limeston wood plastic . the marbl start point wa . g . the limeston wa . g and wood start point . . the end of the experi is that you have to determin the mass of each sampl .
90	1	2	2	addit inform that could be us in order to replic the experi would be to list the actual sampl in the procedur so you can see what your us . secondli in the procedur i made need to what to weigh the mass in for exampl thei didn t tell you to weigh in gram and i wouldn t be abl to complet the experi easili . it doesn t tell how much vinegar to actual pour into each contain in order to replic i would need to know that .
91	1	3	3	i think that know the temperatur in the enjoy would be veri us i m sure it we heat the sampl or froze the sampl we wouldn t get the same result . also we need to know what type of environ we should place thi in . should it be sunni dark windi hot cold etc . i also think we should know what kind of contain and how larg it should be we don t even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the sampl . thi experi is miss too much inform .
92	1	0	0	in order for i for replic thi experi i would need to know what ar the research ing with thi experi what kind of result ar be book at and the mass of each sampl at the end of experi there result .
93	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . you would need to know how long to rins each sampl with distil water and us how much water . you would also need to know how thei determin the mass of the sampl both in the begin and end of the experi and thei exact size of the contain that the sampl ar be place in .
94	1	1	2	in order to replic the experi we would need a control . we would also need the four sampl to us . and anoth thing is what can of vinegar to us and how to weigh the mass of each on . that is what we would need to replic the experi .
95	1	3	1	the addit inform that is need in order to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar that should be place in each contain . the amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid . the result acquir from the experi can be affect if the amount of vinegar wa increas or decreas . therefor the amount of vinegar is need in order to replic the experi .
96	1	0	0	in order to replic thi group procedur you would need to know the independ and depend variabl as well as the control group for the procedur . also to ma he it more clear thei would need to includ a hypothesi of the experi well as a purpos .
97	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi the procedur would have to add more detail . in the first bullet the four sampl should be state as marbl limeston wood and plastic . you should describ the contain where to put the sampl and how much you need . there should be a step where you find the start mass befor the experi . also there should be measur of how much vinegar should be ad . on last thing is when you sai to determin the mass on the procedur it should sai in gram .
98	1	1	1	thei should have told the sampl that wa us . the second thing wa the outcom what happen to the differ .
99	1	3	3	the student need to sai what the sampl ar . thei need to
100	1	2	2	the group should of ad the amount of vinegar us for control . also thei should have compar at least on more trial materi befor repli conclus . the recommend size of the sampl should have also been state in order for the conclus to be easi to compar with other group attempt to complet thi experi .
101	1	3	3	addit inform i would need to replic thi experi would be the actual name of the sampl . in step i would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each contain . also in step i would need the amount of distil water to rins it off with and for how long .
102	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi some addit inform i would need is how the gap determin the mass of the sampl and what did thei us to do so . i would also need to know the amount of vinegar thei us to pour in each contain as well as what kind of contain thei us .
103	1	1	1	first off these group of student forgot to add in step how much vinegar in go to be pour in each ident contain . in step number the student did not sai to organ the sampl so you can record it as separ data becaus each sampl is differ marbl limeston wood plastic . the student also forgot to includ step which is find the differ in mass . if anoth group of student were go to do thi exact experi thei wouldn t know what thei ar compar .
104	1	2	2	if i wa do thi experi i would have taken the temp . of the room i also would have given a measur of how much vinegar i us .
105	1	0	2	after read the group procedur the follow addit inform is need you need to observ the contain when you fill each with the content you will need to make sure each contain ha the veri same amount then also make sure that all the contain ar in the same room temp .
106	1	1	1	the addit inform that is need it the amount of vinegar be pour into each cut . also you need to record all the inform . thei need to know how much water thei ar put into the contain after hour .
107	1	2	3	you would need the size of the contain amount of vinegar us the type of sampl . such as earth wood limeston and plastic and how much of each to put in .
108	1	3	3	in addit to the inform given you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain differ amount could chang the result . there should also be a set temperatur to keep the sampl at becaus chang in temperatur can affect the corros process . in the experi it should have told you the sampl should be somewhat even size .
109	1	1	1	addit inform that is need in order to replic the experi is the measur cent of the liquid pour into the cup . also wa size cup ar the liquid pour into . in the procedur it sai pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident contain . that is the addit inform that is need in order to replic the experi .
110	1	0	0	some addit inform thei could have ad wa thei thei should have weigh the sampl befor thei put in the vinegar .
111	1	0	0	for each box thei should have done it time so thei would have an averag .
112	1	1	1	i would need to know what materi i am get to begin thi experi . what should i be look for when experi is go on how do i determin the ma of each segment .
113	1	1	1	some addit inform you would need to replic the experi is in the procedur includ what type of sampl your us also do explain why you ar us vinegar . final to tell the reader what your weigh with and why .
114	1	2	2	if i wa to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each contain the size of the contain and what wa us to weigh the sampl .
115	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you should know how much of each sampl you were suppos to start with what you were try to determin from thi experi and you should know how the contain were kept room temperatur outsid etc .
116	1	0	0	in order to replic thi thi experi you would need the start mass end mass and differ in mass .
117	1	2	3	you would need to find out and label the differ size and shape of the sampl you don t pour the vinegar in instead you sai to drop in each contain . you want everyth to be the same and when you pour you don t alwai get the exact amount for each contain . also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar .
118	1	0	0	your go to need how much is there in total .
119	1	0	0	pour vinegar in each of the four separ but ident contain . p place on sampl in a contain and do the same for the rest p after hour remov sampl and rins p sit and dry for min . p determin the mile .
120	1	2	3	to replic thi experi you would need to know the mass amount of vinegar us in each cup . it is also necessari to know the temperatur of the room that the experi wa perform in . a differ temperatur could speed or slow the reaction in each cup . the last piec of inform requir would be he size of the cup us in the experi . the volum of the cup and or the shape of the cup could complet alter the result of the experi .
121	1	1	1	to replic the experi i would give the requir tool in a list so peopl can be more prepar i would also be more specif on the word sampl to describ rock and stone . and most importantli i would make a control i would put marbl limeston wood and plastic in water .
122	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need some addit inform . first of all i would need to know how much vinegar to us in each contain . second of all i would need to know the materi i would be place in the vinegar .
123	1	1	2	what you would need to know to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup . also you would need to list the materi you were us . anoth thing you would need to know is what measur of the mass would you us .
124	1	1	1	you would need what sampl there what you do after number .
125	1	0	0	it would have been better to have had three trial for the data and to have an averag for the data . also a total of the data could have been better too .
126	1	3	3	first you would need to know what the sampl ar that thei ar talk about . next you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put in each contain . you could also need to how long you should rins each sampl .
127	1	0	0	the addit inform i would need to erad the experi i would explain the look of the outcom of the experi . i would put after hour remov the sampl from the contain rins each sampl w distil water . allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut . instead of put determin the mass of each sampl . i would tell you the outcom on what happen and how the experi turn out .
128	1	0	0	i will need to add on them sub ten by how mani number their ar . the sampl ha the amount of four layer it is to divid by eight .
129	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi a control would need to be establish . also a mass would need to be determin so that everi materi had the same mass at the begin of the experi . in order to accur replic thi experi it would help to know if the contain were cover or uncov for the hour .
130	1	3	3	we would word correct safeti measur to take the control the effect of vinegar what temperatur to store them at what the ident contain ar made of and it size what type of scale to us to mean it the amount of vinegar in each contain i more trial
131	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi there ar a few more thing i need to know . the problem doe not state what the four differ sampl ar . second i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup . the amount of vinegar could impact the mass . last i would need to where to store the sampl for the hour period . differ temperatur might affect the differ sampl .
132	1	2	2	thi question would need to includ the measur of the contain the amount of vinegar pour in each cup .
133	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what she contain to us and how to measur the mass of the sampl . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain .
134	1	0	0	you would need to know the portion of what thei us as not to ruin the experi or not us enough or too much mai not give you the same result .
135	1	3	3	in order to replic the lab the student did you would need to know what materi were need . what kind of area ar you go to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the sampl .
136	1	2	3	the addit inform that is need in the procedur is thei should state what sampl ar go to be us . also thei should includ how much vinegar we need to pour into the contain becaus differ amount could have differ result . lastli it should includ the size of the contain becaus it could have a differ result .
137	1	2	1	addit inform to be includ into the procedur to replic it would have to be to clarifi in the first step what the sampl ar go to be . it would also be good if you were to add where you should put your sampl while thei ar sit in the vinegar . it would have clarifi the procedur also if it were ad what we should us to measur the sampl . it would also be help if the procedur includ how much of each sampl to test .
138	1	3	3	after read the group s procedur addit inform that a would need in order to replic the experi ar that a need to know the size of the contain that the sampl ar put in for thei need to be ident . u also need to know that amount of sampl u need to put in each contain in order to obtain the same start mass the group of student receiv from the sampl . anoth factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the contain concern the old exampl of the experi . anoth good price of inform would be the locat where the sampl ar dry and amount of sunlight .
139	1	3	3	some addit inform need would be where the contain ar to sit . such as in the sun or in the refriger . how much vinegar ar we put into contain and what kind of contain ar us
140	1	2	2	the student should sai in the experi what sampl ar be us . thei should also sai how much water thei should us when thei ar distil the sampl and thei also need to sai how much vinegar thei ar pour into each label cup .
141	1	2	2	three addit piec of inform that i would need to know to replic thi experi would be what exactli the four sampl ar of how much vinegar to pour into each contain and what exactli the purpos or problem statement for thi experi wa . also how much distil water i would need to us .
142	1	2	2	in the procedur i would also need to know how much vinegar to us which scale of measur thei ar us and how big each contain is .
143	1	3	2	in order to complet thi experi you would need addit inform . you would need to know the list of materi to have everyth to complet your experi . you would also need to know where the experi wa perform to weigh ani outsid factor . you might also need to know to know the constant . what type of vinegar and what time you start .
144	1	3	3	to replic thi experi you would also need to know vinegar thei us the size of the cup and the the size of the sampl .
145	1	2	2	after read the procedur there were a few thing i need to know to replic the experi . on thing is the amount of vinegar us . anoth is how much water to us when rins it . the last thing is how to store the sampl for hour . there were a few problem with thi procedur .
146	1	3	3	i would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the contain be cover or not it would be help to know what type of contain should the materi be put into .
147	1	1	1	i need to know how big the contain is how mani of them .
148	1	2	2	what ar the sampl what is the materi us how much vinegar is pour in the contain .
149	1	0	0	the student should have made a hypothesi of what thei thought wa go to happen . also thei should have state what thei were investig . thei should have made a conclus from the result .
150	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need addit inform like how much vinegar wa pour into the separ contain what tool to us such as safeti goggl and have more trial .
151	1	1	1	thei need to add what the sampl were how the mass should be determin thei need to tell you to tabl the contain and you need to record tour data .
152	1	2	1	some addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi would be how much vinegar do i put in each contain . also what am i suppos to label the contain i m not quit sure how to measur the mass by us a scale . if so the same scale for each sampl . also how big ar the sampl suppos to be .
153	1	3	3	to replic thi experi you would need to know the volum of the vinegar in the cup the temperatur of the surround and the exact acid of the vinegar on the ph scale .
154	1	0	0	to replic the group experi you would need to add inform even as if the lab is valid .
155	1	2	3	you would need to add how much vinegar is need to be pour in the contain . i think the student should have start out with the same mass . what type of vinegar and doe temperatur matter .
156	1	0	0	some addit inform would be how much of each sampl would be put into the vinegar . also mayb not have then sit for hour but had then sit less . thei could also have rins them with replica water instead of distil water .
157	1	2	2	the addit inform necessari to replic the experi ar p . the amount of vinegar to pour thi must remain constant in a credibl experi . p . the type of sampl us should be in the procedur . p .
158	1	1	1	to replic the experi you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the contain . we know that marbl lost gram limeston lost . gram plastic lost gram and wood stai the same but we need to know how much vinegar wa us for each sampl .
159	1	0	0	we had all the inform we need to do the experi we alreadi know that wood is the on that ha more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least on but mayb if thei would ve explain it better to be abl to complet the mass becaus it look like thei onli have estim for the mass .
160	1	2	2	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is the differ in mass from the begin of the experi to the end of the experi . you d also need to know what all the sampl were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each contain .
161	1	1	1	to replic the group procedur i would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the contain how much of on sampl materi do thei want and how thei want us to determin the mass .
162	1	1	1	there ar a coupl addit that should be made to replic the lab accur . in procedur it doe not sai to measur the mass of the sampl i or without a petra dish . it also should sai that thei should be measur with a particular instrument such as balanc beam . anoth part that wa left out wa that thei forgot to tell how much vinegar the four sampl need becaus if on get more than anoth it might chang the weight and how much water princ the sampl with .
163	1	1	1	you would need to tell what type of sampl thei ar . also what type of utensil to us to measur the mass of the sampl . also would need repeat or replic trial to re test the experi . or you ll also need to tell what to label the contain by in thi experi you ll also need to reach the mass or how each sampl look by us your five sens or whatev or not to make a data same to show your result .
164	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what kind of sampl i am us . the group state to determin the mass of four sampl but doe not tell me what kind of materi these sampl ar . also it would be help to know how much of each sampl i should measur . again thi group procedur is veri be detail and it would help to make the experi as accur as possibl to know how much of the sampl i should be us . final in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar i should add to each sampl . differ amount of vinegar will affect each sampl differ make the experi inaccur .
165	1	2	2	in order to be abl to duplic thi experi you need the follow inform how much vinegar to us . also how big ar the contain i . e what is what is their volum . and lastli how much of each sampl to put into the contain .
166	1	1	1	addit inform i would need is how much vinegar wa put onto each sampl . thi is becaus if more vinegar is put on on sampl than anoth it will most like after the mass in differ wai for exampl if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would .
167	1	0	0	in order to replic thi experi you would need to state exactli how much of a certain chemic you need to pour . in most case it is imper that you get the right amount of a substanc or your result mai be suffici .
168	1	3	3	to repeat thi experi i would need to know the four differ sampl without know that i don t know what i m test . i also need to know how much vinegar in each of the cup . i would need to know where to put all of the differ contain . i don t know if thei need to stai at room temp cold or not .
169	1	0	0	you should repeat each step in the experi . start with step and go all the wai to step .
170	1	1	1	to replic thi procedur you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the contain . you would also need to know when you start to know when to finish the experi .
171	1	1	0	what materi should we us becaus in order to do thi experi it ha to tell us what substanc ar be us . their procedur also doe not tell us to get a start weight .
172	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur in order to replic the experi i would need to know the size of the contain becaus the smaller the contain the more dens pack the sampl ar . i would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experi .
173	1	1	0	the procedur ha to be more specif . it should includ that the experi need an end mass and the differ of the begin and end . it should have materi list . it should have within the procedur a mini procedur for each materi .
174	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know addit inform such as the four differ sampl that thei us becaus i could have chosen metal cardboard and mani other sampl materi that thei didn t us and would get differ result . also i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour becaus thi can caus a major chang . lastli thei might want to tell where to sit the sampl while thei dry for minut becaus if thei ar sit in room temp . or by a light sourc make a differ too .
175	1	1	1	to replic the experi thei would need to tell you how much vinegar to put in the cup have all the rock wai the same and tell us why thei ar do the experi .
176	1	2	2	to replic the procedur i would need to know the amount of vinegar need how much distil water need to rins the sampl and the type of sampl .
177	1	2	2	these student procedur wa not a reliabl on . the materi need to mention what kind of materi thei us . is there onli reduc to ism the sampl . thei also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup . the materi also that not includ in control group . which is a center post or ani experi . thei student variabl uncheck . thei also includ onli the trial .
178	1	1	1	i would need to know the amount of vinegar ad to each sampl which have to be the same replic the experi .
179	1	2	3	the addit inform i would need to know in order to replic the experi is what kind of sampl thei ar us . in step it tell me to determin the mass of four differ sampl but doesn t tell me which kind . in step it tell me to pour vinegar into each contain but doesn t tell me what size or type of contain . after sampl ar remov from the contain after hour i need to find the mass of each sampl . step but thei don t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slur hf .
180	1	1	1	the group need to add what to label becaus
181	1	0	1	first i would sai you need to get all materi befor you do ani of that . what would we us to get the mass of the differ materi and where would we place the contain while we ar wait for the result .
182	1	3	3	first you would need to know exactli how much vinegar to pour into each of the ident contain . you would also need to know what the size and materi the contain is made out of . lastli thei should tell you where to leav the contain such as in the sun in a dry cold place etc .
183	1	2	2	in step we need to know what sampl . it should list the type of rock . p in step how long should the sampl be rins for an amount of time should given . p in step it should sai to correct the new mass of each sampl .
184	1	1	1	the procedur is not clear thei need to sai the sampl name becaus we don t know what it is . also thei need to sai why to measur the mass of the four differ sampl befor put it in the vinegar . final thei should repeat the experi a sever time so to see the differ and mayb thei should keep the sampl in the contain for a longer time to see the result .
185	1	0	0	we would need observ dure the whole experi mayb repeat of the experi to see if anyth chang . also try anoth sampl .
186	1	2	2	the experi is lack sever piec of inform about the procedur . for exampl the amount of vinegar ad to the contain is not describ . the method of determin the mass as well as the four sampl materi ha not been specifi in the procedur inform .
187	1	1	1	. i would have to know what kind of area i would have to leav it in for hour . temperatur p . i would have to know what kind of wood to us if there ha ani specif . p . also in step it doe not sai what i have to us to determin the mass of the rock plastic and wood .
188	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi you need to know what the sampl ar taken of what size the sampl should be what size the contain should be and how much vinegar is to be us on each sampl .
189	1	0	0	in thi group s procedur some addit inform should ve been what were the label name .
190	1	2	2	addit inform you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar . you would also need to know the size of the contain and how much vinegar you would us .
191	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi i believ that the inform want would be the start row end mass and differ in mass . the addit inform in my opinion would be how the structur chang throughout the procedur . i f you were to record thi data at becaus the procedur would be success to see the differ on mass in four sampl
192	1	0	0	i think that thei should have did the project more than onc probabl about two more time to see if there project wa right and thei also should have written out there conclus as well as put it on a graph .
193	1	0	0	in the procedur you would need to add the time in which the stone rock plastic began to chang when vinegar wa ad to them . thei could have to explain when thei would chang or what time for each on marbl limeston wood and plastic . in the procedur it onli explain after hour but thei didn t write down the time differ for each on thei onli put the overal time .
194	1	1	1	after read the group procedur i found more addit piec of inform oti so that i can duplic the experi . i need to know the independ variabl depend variabl and how much vinegar to pour into each separ contain .
195	1	3	3	after read that group s procedur on addit piec of inform you would need to replic that experi is what the four differ sampl were . anoth thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sampl . the last piec of addit inform you would need is how big each of the sampl should be .
196	1	3	3	the addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi ar the mass of the contain becaus if you place the substanc in with the sampl in order to find the mass of onli the sampl you need to subtract the mass of the contain . also it is necessari to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sampl . i also need to know what type of environ to put the sampl when i am wait hour . lastli i need to know what type of contain to put the sampl in becaus it mai have an affect on how the sampl react .
197	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the person perform it should do a few thing differ . first thei should state what materi thei ar us second thei should have a set measur of how much vinegar to pour into each contain and third thei should state that you must find the differ of the start and end mass .
198	1	1	1	need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain how you ar go to get the mass of the sampl and how thei ar go to calcul the differ should be includ in the student procedur .
199	1	3	3	to replic the experi you would need to know the kind of word us . you should also need to know how long you would have to rins the sampl in the distil water . the size of the contain would be essenti as well so you would know how much vinegar should be us .
200	1	0	0	addit inform that you would need in order to replic the experi would be for the group to explain how to determin the mass of the materi to find out what the start mass wa to explain more specif how to place the materi in separ contain for less confus and to explain how you find the end mass and the differ in mass .
201	1	0	0	you would need more marbl limeston wood and plastic .
202	1	1	1	you would need the amount of vinegar the sampl sat in . the amount of water thei where rins in and the amount of each sampl .
203	1	0	0	i don t know what replic mean so i don t know how to answer thi question
204	1	3	3	first it doesn t tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four contain . next it doesn t sai how to allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut mayb thei need a cover for it but we don t know from thi inform . in addit there is an inform about how thei determin the mass .
205	1	2	2	in the group s procedur three thing need to do is tell how much vinegar should be pour in the contain how much of a sampl should be ad and what condit the contain were place in for the hour .
206	1	3	3	. what kind of sampl of materi ar you us . . how much vinegar should we put in the contain . . thei should be more clear about how to rins each sampl .
207	1	2	2	i need to know how much vinegar . i need to pour on each of pour separ but ident contain . i need to know what the four differ sampl ar .
208	1	0	0	in order to replic experi acid rain you will need get four separ but ident contain the materi marbl limeston wood and plastic . after you have these materi you need to weigh them befor you put each of them in their own contain after you have these materi you need to weigh them befor you put each of them in their own contain . after hour rins the solut off and weigh the mass again .
209	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each contain . also i would need to know of each sampl wa ar solid piec or n small or piec . the great would need to identifi
210	1	1	1	thei would have to add put each four differ sampl in four separ but ident contain in which you pour the vinegar . butter have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four ident contain .
211	1	3	3	the procedur is miss a few initi detail about the experi . there should be a control of how much vinegar is place into each cup and the percentag of the vinegar should also be same to each cup . the group should explain more on how the sampl will be wash sinc if thei wash them in a per a sink piec could chip off decreas the mass . the group also need to be more specif on the contain be us whether thei have atop and if thei all ar the same color and size .
212	1	0	0	tool .
213	1	2	2	a desir addit piec of inform would be a control group for the experi . the it would also be help to determin why thi experi wa be perform as well as know if the sampl were cover or not and how much vinegar to us .
214	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would have to know what the four sampl ar . the experi doe tell you and it would be imposs to do it without . the experi should have told us that vinegar wa a substitut for acid rain . that mai confus a person who want to do thi lab . also the lab should have said what type of contain whether it is a beaker test tube or a differ type of contain .
215	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain to insur each sampl ha to same amount to react to . i would need to also know which type of contain to us .
216	1	2	2	on piec of inform need is write sampl you will be work with in the procedur . thei repeat over and over about differ sampl but never onc tell you what thei were . the second piec of inform need is let the peopl who ar do the experi know that thei must make a tabl and record the start mass end mass and then the differ between the two for each sampl . final the rd thing thei should make known is how much of each sampl is need and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measur is be us .
217	1	1	1	the addit inform that i would need in order to replic thi experi is where do i leav the contain after i finish put all the sampl into differ contain .
218	1	1	1	addit inform that would be need for the procedur would be how someon find the mass of the sampl and us what to find the mass what ar the sampl marbl limeston wood and plastic and how to find the differ in mass .
219	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the contain how long to rins each sampl and with how much distil water . i think you would need to know these thing becaus all three could affect the end mass therefor ruin the experi . also i would want to have a control group in my experi to see if it wa realli the vinegar affect the mass . so i would our water in differ contain and do the same thing .
220	1	0	1	the group would need to put in the materi more inform on what to do and add the measur into be a good procedur .
221	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need to replic the experi is how mani ml of vinegar ar pour to each four separ contain not onli that but what is the materi that is suppos to be sampl and what ar the four differ sampl these ar inform s i need to replic the procedur .
222	1	2	2	the first thing is why the student ar do thi experi . then the second piec of inform is the amount of vinegar put in each contain . the student also should of told how much distil water wa us to rins each sampl . final their should be a conclus and a list of materi .
223	1	1	1	first thei should of put the amount of vinegar be us . thei don t sai to record there data .
224	1	2	2	addit inform that would be need in order to replic the experi would be the follow p . explain what the four differ sampl would be . p . explain how much of vinegar should exactli be pour into the four ident cup . p . anoth thing is for them to how much distil water should be us when rins the sampl . p . indic is a differ amount of liquid with differ mass of sampl .
225	1	0	0	i
226	1	1	1	in order to repeat thi experi i would need to get the sampl materi that thei us . in thi experi thei us marbl limeston wood plastic . the second step is to find the mass of the four sampl . then follow the procedur that thei give you to do the experi . that how i would do thi experi over .
227	1	1	1	we would need to know what the investig wa need to know what kind of sampl their talk about . what thei us to determin the mass . all of thi inform will help the reader help understand the investig better .
228	1	3	2	you would need to know the amount of vinegar pour into the contain what order to put sampl in take them out allai onc and how long to rins for .
229	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar wa us how much distil water wa us and what kind of contain were us .
230	1	0	0	the student still need to make a hypothesi a graph and find the differ in mass .
231	1	2	2	on piec of inform i would need to know in order to replic the group s procedur is how much of each sampl did thei put into each vinegar fill contain . i would also need to know how much vinegar wa us in each sampl contain . i would also need to know how much distil water to us when clean the sampl . if i us differ amount of water when wash the sampl on mai not be as thoroughli wash as anoth which could mess up the result .
232	1	2	2	some addit inform we would need in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar do we pour into the contain how do we determin the mass of the four sampl and how long do we rins the sampl with distil water .
233	1	0	0	you need limeston and marbl .
234	1	1	1	the inform i would need in order to replic the experi is after you allow the sampl to stand dry for minut doe it have to dry in a cool area what type of area it ha to dry in and after it sit for min what happen after you determin the mass
235	1	0	0	in order to rest thi experi thei could have multipl trial . and also kept the lab go for hour in place as thei also need ti have a tv and do content . thei also could or tabl their data up and made a graph to show increas or decreas
236	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i need to know the materi what kind of sampl materi and why ar thei do the experi . how much vinegar rins or how long
237	1	0	0	determin the end mass determin the differ in mass . also the mass or everyth marbl limeston wood and plastic . you would need to add up all three mass start end and the differ in mass then you will get the answer to all of them .
238	1	1	2	the step that thi procedur is miss would be to list gather all materi becaus you need to know what you ar work with nd sai how much vinegar to pour into the contain the other part that thi procedur is miss is how much distil water do you rins each sampl with . if you don t have thi inform it would make the experi veri off with valid s . the contain wouldn t be the same .
239	1	3	3	the group need to add into their procedur the specifi substanc made limeston wood plastic instead of just sai differ sampl . thei also sai determin the mass of that substanc but thei need to specif sai how to determin the mass scale . thei need to sai how much vinegar rate into the contain and sai what kind of contain should be us . lastli at the end thei again need to specifi what to weigh the sampl with and how .
240	1	2	2	you would need to know how lag of a contain to us for the sampl . also you would need to know exactli what volum the vinegar is to keep no result accur . final you would need to know how to measur the mass of the sampl what instrument to us .
241	1	3	3	to replic the experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step . in step a person would need to know the temperatur the sampl ar wait hour in . in step the procedur state a sampl of on materi unless the materi were given to the experiment bit readi the procedur the actual name of each of the materi should be given . temperatur for step would also be good addit info as well .
242	1	2	2	i would need to know exactli how much vinegar to place in each contain . what four type of materi we need for the experi to know that we need to find the differ between the mass of the materi befor and after the experi in order replic the experi .
243	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you will need amount of vinegar us the size of the contain and and the amount of time us for each step of the experi . these ar three import thing or info that thei need in order to replic the experi .
244	1	2	2	some addit inform the student come of includ could be what type of materi were thei put in . anoth piec of inform is how much vinegar wa put into each contain . anoth piec of inform when to or how much wa the sampl weigh and how you weigh it .
245	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i would have to know a few more thing . on thing i need to know is the temperatur at which thei did the experi . i would also need to know how much vinegar wa us in the contain . lastli i would need to know the appropri time for rins the sampl .
246	1	0	0	the addit inform that i would need to replic thi experi is the marbl sampl the limeston sampl and the wood sampl and the plastic sampl . i would follow the procedur step by step .
247	1	1	1	addit inform you would need in order to replic thi experi is a littl to show what the student ar experi . includ write down the data in the experi . make step to separ step . also how to find the differ in mass from the start mass to the end mass . anoth thing to make the experi better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each contain .
248	1	1	1	first you would need a control . the absenc of what is effect the depend . in thi case the depend variabl is the mass of the materi and the vinegar is effect it so the control would be the materi subject to water instead of vinegar . thi group had don t write down the amount of vinegar . it veri import that thi amount is held constant throughout the experi . thei should also mention the mass of each materi becaus each of them have to have the same mass in order for the result to be accur and reliabl .
249	1	2	2	there is addit inform need in the procedur to replic thi experi . i need to know what the four start sampl ar . also thi procedur need to includ weigh the sampl . i need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sampl . lastli at the end you need to weigh the sampl out again to measur the differ in weight .
250	1	1	1	three addit peac of inform you need is what type of vinegar and at what ph . also the lb of the sampl .
251	1	0	1	you would need to put the object need to sampl thi experi . also you need a hypothesi and a conclus .
252	1	3	3	thei need to state how much vinegar to pour in each contain what kind of sampl to us and how much test need to be done after hour .
253	1	1	1	what addit inform that mai be need in order to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar befor the experi also the amount of vinegar after take each sampl out of the cup . howev includ inform about time wouldn t hart the icon t either .
254	1	3	3	. firstli the group could provid more inform about the materi such is what thei ar how big thei ar what categori the materi need to be in order to conduct thi experi p . the group doe not explain how much vinegar should be poorer into the contain how much is need p . the group doe not tell what should be us to take out the sampl from the contain . even though thi is just vinegar their procedur doe not follow the safeti rule of the lab . goggl inclus would also be rise .
255	1	2	2	the procedur should includ what sampl thei ar test . thei need to includ the amount of vinegar in each up in metric format . the wai of mass the sampl should be clearer and should also explain that each sampl should be mass separ .
256	1	3	3	addit inform that you will need in order to replic the experi wa how much vinegar wa put into contain . how long do you rins the sampl do the sampl stai outsid or insid dai or night
257	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to know the follow inform what ar four sampl you would need to know that so the experi will be the same . thei should also includ the amount of vinegar that you need . the last thing thei should includ is ar you pour it on the sampl or just in the contain
258	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i will need to know how much vinegar goe into the contain . also i would need to know what kind of sampl thei ar us for thi experi . and final i need to know if it is weigh in gram pound or ani other measur .
259	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separ contain . you would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each contain . the last thing you would need to know is how much sampl to put in the contain and make sure it the same type of sampl you us at ani time .
260	1	2	2	the addit inform that would be need in order to replic the experi the number of trial thei did in order to do the experi the amount of vinegar to put in the contain the differ sampl thei us need to be state in procedur and the amount of the sampl place in the contain .
261	1	0	0	you would need to add observ you would also need to add the time on the tabl .
262	1	0	0	the addit inform that is need to replic thi experi would be how long the test sampl would stai insid of the contain . you would also need to know what substanc is also mix in with the vinegar . you will also need to have contain and thei have to be label by which substanc is insid of the contain .
263	1	0	0	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the mass of it with the distil water .
264	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi the group will have to start over again by determin the mass of the marbl limeston wood and the plastic . pour the vinegar into their contain . place the materi into the contain and wait hour . mai be the mass will be differ mai be it will be the same .
265	1	3	3	there is some addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi first i would need to know what the four differ sampl ar . second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the contain . third i would need to know what type of contain i should us . last i would need to know where to keep the contain dure the hour . these ar the thing i would need to know to replic the experi .
266	1	1	1	the other inform i would need to replic thi experi is what do we us for the sampl how much each sampl do we us and how do we determin the mass of each sampl
267	1	1	1	after read thi group s procedur i found that thei left out the amount of vinegar that wa ad to each cup . thi inform is vital becaus if thi experi were to be replic the result would vari among other replic from the origin test the data obtain from a replic of thi experi it would be fals and the procedur could t be replic . therefor it is clear that the amount of vinegar pour in each cup is vital inform to thi experi .
268	1	1	0	the first thing that i would need in order to replic the acid rain experi is my differ sampl . the next thing i will need is the vinegar to pour on our sampl the last thing i need is a place al to measur the start mass g and the end mass g to find out the differ in mass g .
269	1	0	0	i guess follow the step to make the experi is right like allow to dry in min . let it be separ with the vinegar the littl contain . go over to make sure noth goe wrong .
270	1	3	3	the student need to includ what the sampl were . you can t do an experi if you don t know what you re test on . the student should also includ the temp . that the contain were store at for hour . lastli thei should includ how much vinegar wa pour into each contain . thei could ve put the same amount or differ amount . thei could ve put littl or a lot .
271	1	2	0	the addit inform that i would need is how mani step we will need to do to get data . what is the best contain to put the sampl in and doe it have to be the same kind of contain . i would also need how much mani time you need to rins the sampl .
272	1	1	3	in order to replic thi group experi we would need to know the ph of the vinegar how much vinegar wa us for each sampl and specif such as the type of materi us ie . balsa wood compar with pine or type or type of plastic .
273	1	1	2	to replic thi experi you would need to have a list of materi so you would know which sampl to us you need to know how larg the sampl ar and you need to know why you ar do the experi .
274	1	1	1	if try to replic thi experi you would need more inform . you need to know how much vinegar to poor into the contain . you will also need to know what to label your contain . how do you determin the mass of the sampl when try an experi you need to make sure that you have all of the correct inform befor start your project .
275	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the materi your us . thi procedur doe not state the materi need so you have no idea what to put in the contain full of vinegar .
276	1	1	1	the student did not make it clear as to what materi thei us as sampl . thei also didn t specifi how much of each sampl . thei also did not indic why the mass wa lost or where it went .
277	1	2	2	some addit inform that s need in order to replic thi experi ar the name kind of each sampl the measur of each sampl pour into the contain and the amount of vinegar pour into each contain as well .
278	1	1	1	some inform that is miss that thei don t sai what size of contain and thei don t sai what to do with data .
279	1	1	1	in order to replic the procedur of the experi you would also need to know how much vinegar thei us and if it is the same for all of them . you would also need to do anoth trial as the extra inform would valid the experi more .
280	1	1	1	to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar is be pour in . i would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student sampl . lastli how much of the sampl should be get ad to the contain weather or not all of it or half of it should be ad .
281	1	3	3	to tell the amount vinegar you pour into the contain the size of the contain ho long you rins the sampl off with distil water . how mani time you repeat each sampl to get down to a writer mass .
282	1	1	1	thi procedur should state the materi that thei ar us to gather the materi . first it ha to sai to put on their ey protect . it also need to state how on would go about determin the mass of the four sampl . lastli there need to be a step on how to find the differ in the mass and to remind the reader to record their result .
283	1	0	0	sai what you ar try figur out in the first place . p it s not enough into figur out what is go on . p we need to know more clearli how to do each step .
284	1	1	0	first i would add that the student might want to add a list of materi that thei need . a hypothesi and write a question to what there try to figur out .
285	1	1	1	in order to repeat the student procedur thei need to tell how much of each sampl is to be place into each cup . thei also should state how long the sampl ar to be rins . if there ar differ amount in each cup the experi will not be valid .
286	1	2	2	thei did not tell us what to measur with thei also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of contain .
287	1	2	1	in order to replic thi experi i would also need materi i would us . i would need the amount of vinegar in the contain and i would also need time limit to do the test .
288	1	0	0	some inform i would need to know is how would the water be if
289	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i would need to know more inform . i would need to know the hypothesi on what is go to happen . also i don t know how much vinegar to pore in each cup . thi procedur also should specifi what materi to us line what brand of cup or size .
290	1	1	1	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar thei pour into the four separ contain . thei also forgot to sai the amount of water thei need to rins each sampl .
291	1	3	3	first thei should list the sampl thei us . marbl limeston wood and plastic in their procedur . thei should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sampl to have the same effect . thei should have also said to put their contain in same sort of cabinet as a refriger or someth . not just leav it out of their process .
292	1	0	0	in order to complet the experi you would need to know each temp . by hour bic it s record after a war period . you would also need to know the mass befor it wa left to ani for minut .
293	1	1	1	to add to the experi design the group should keep the amount of vinegar and contain as control variabl . follow thi you will
294	1	1	1	addit inform that would be good to now is why ar the student perform thi xpirement why arent there cup a for measur for distil water amount or vinegar amount you should also know why the start mass for the materi all arent the same .
295	1	1	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar the group pour in each contain without know the amount of vinegar i would get differ result .
296	1	0	0	you will need more mass and you have to dry it for minut . after hour remov the sampl from the contain and note each sampl with distil water . you will probabl need more of a littl bit of everyth .
297	1	1	1	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi ar what to us to determin the mass which would be a tripl beam balanc . you would also need to know the amount of the sampl that would be need to more in step . you would also need to know what the sampl you ar test ar . those sampl would be marbl limeston wood and plastic .
298	1	2	2	in order to replic the group s experi i would need the follow inform what the sampl ar how much vinegar to put into each contain and how much of each sampl .
299	1	1	1	the inform that is need to replic thi experi would be that firstli thei need a hypothesi . secondli thei need to list all object thei us lastli thei need to state weather their hypothesi wa wasn t correct .
300	1	1	1	the group of student should add a control to see the differ between the sampl and the control . in the experi procedur also doesn t put the differ sampl of four like marbl limeston wood plastic the purpos of thi experi should be a group of student what is the differ sampl of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time .
301	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to know the size of the contain the amount of each materi to start with and the amount of vinegar us .
302	1	3	3	i would need the amount of vinegar to put in each contain . how long to rins it in water materi . and what kind of contain ca social us .
303	1	3	2	in order to replic thi experi you must also know how much vinegar goe in each contain how the mass is be determin and where the contain should be put for the hour what type of climat .
304	1	1	1	to duplic thi experi you would also need to know the brand of all the product on it accur the environ the experi wa in and what kind of scale wa us so that the replic experi is ident make it move accur .
305	1	2	2	the addit inform that i need in order to replic the experi is the name of the specif differ sampl . i also need to know how much vinegar is need . furthermor i need to know the amount of each sampl need . final thi procedur doe not explain how to determin the mass of each sampl .
306	1	0	0	to replic thi experi addit inform you would need is a time chart to keep track of time .
307	1	2	2	their ar three thing wrong with thi procedur . on is thei did not tabl the four ident contain the second is thei need to tell how much vinegar is need . the third mistak is how long do we rins with distil water .
308	1	1	1	to replic the experi i would need to know what to do to the control . also i would need to know how much vinegar need to give into each separ contain . lastli i would have all of the sampl be the same weight becaus their experi doe not have and of those list .
309	1	2	3	on piec of inform that would be help to know is how much vinegar do we put in the contain . anoth piec of info is at what temperatur do we let it sit . and lastli it would be us to know whether it should be in the light or the dark .
310	1	0	0	you will need to place the sampl in on contain and repeat with the remain sampl in a singl contain . after the hour is over remov sampl and rins . have the sampl sit and dry for min .
311	1	2	2	addit inform you would need in order to replic thi experi is tell us the four differ sampl how much vinegar is need to be pour into the for differ contain and what should thei be label .
312	1	1	2	you would need the inform to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain the inform to know which sampl had the greatest differ in mass and the inform to which materi to us in step .
313	1	3	3	three piec of procedur would need to be further explain in order to replic the experi . first is how much vinegar should be allow to each individu cup as differ amount of the substanc mai have differ effect on the sampl . the next bit of info would be the size and shape of all sampl though the mass is given the surfac area of each materi is not . third is the condit that the cup must be put in dure the hour wait period . should thei be cover or place in a concentr environ factor like thi can have a larg effect on the experi .
314	1	1	1	thi experi is not right becaus thei would need to tell how much vinegar thei put in each cup and it will have to all be the same .
315	1	0	0	the inform the student left out wa the control . the control of the experi wa the action of the vinegar in the water that affect the sampl .
316	1	1	1	addit inform that would be need to replic thi experi is how much vinegar to us and how much of each materi to put into the vinegar . also the experi doesn t sai how to remov the materi from the vinegar .
317	1	0	0	after read thi procedur i think it would need task need . tell what it is you ar do and what solut and a hypothesi .
318	1	1	0	the first thing thei should have done would be to chang the first thing i . e the procedur to gather materi . thi let peopl know what materi your us . also thi procedur wasn t word clearli . like pour vinegar into separ but ident contain . that make no sens and is hard to understand . thei also never tell you how thei got the mass of the sampl .
319	1	2	2	the addit inform you would need to replic the experi is to mention what the four differ sampl ar tell how much vinegar wa us in each contain and how mani remain sampl ar go to be us .
320	1	1	0	thei didn t includ the temperatur of the contain . thei didn t have trial of test .
321	1	2	2	you would need to know how big the measur were do the sampl sit to dry .
322	1	3	3	the group should be more specif includ the name of the sampl add rain sampl etc . . thei should specifi what kind of contain to pour the vinegar into in step . in step thei should sai where to put the sampl after thei have been remov from the contain .
323	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain becaus if on sampl had more vinegar in it contain it might lose more mass . also i need to know what should i do with the contain onc i ve label them . the experi s result might chang if we ar suppos to cap the contain or heat them you don t know what to do . lastli how much water should i rins the sampl with if differ amount ar us the weight could differ .
324	1	2	2	if i a just look at the peopl and i wa to repeat thi experi i would need to know what the four differ sampl were doe the distil water need to be a after temperatur and how much vinegar do i add to the sampl .
325	1	3	3	to replic thi experi the reader need to know what kind of sampl to us how much vinegar to us and what kind of contain to us . the procedur is veri vagu . a scientist would need much more specif inform in order to perform the experi . therefor the student should specifi the marbl limeston wood plastic . thei should also specifi the amount of vinegar need as well as the type of contain that should be us .
326	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi the mass of differ sampl should be held constant there should be a control group . the experi should includ how mani time the contain were rins and if it wa rins with cold hot or warm water it should also includ where the sampl were kept and the temperatur thei were kept at . also what wa the group investig in should be includ .
327	1	3	3	how much vinegar you pour into the cup . what kind of vinegar you us . what kind of contain you should us .
328	1	2	2	to make thi procedur repeat we would first need to know the four sampl we would be work with . otherwis we couldn t even start the experi . we would also need to know how much vinegar in ml to pour in the cup .
329	1	2	2	to replic the experi i would need addit inform . for exampl how much vinegar should be pour into each contain i would also want to know the size of each sampl and make sure the surfac area of each is as close to equal as possibl . lastli i would want to know how much distil water to rins each sampl with . with thi inform i am certainli capabl of repeat the experi .
330	1	2	2	after read the group procedur i wa left wonder what ar the four differ sampl thei ar pour . all thei tell us is vinegar . also what is the size of the contain how much of each sampl is be pour into the contain the group would need to tell us these fact so we can follow their step to do the same experi .
331	1	0	0	i think from read the procedur thei should ve ad inform describ the look befor and after see if there were ani physic chang . if someth wa to chang then the group should ve got it down so we know the featur of the item .
332	1	2	2	after read the group procedur to replic thi experi i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sampl so the result ar accur . thei would also need to includ the four sampl name marbl limeston wood and plastic . so i know what everyth what everyth is so i can creat a data tabl . thei would also need to includ in the procedur that when mass the substanc i would first need to zero the contain on the scale and then bar the sampl in .
333	1	0	0	more inform is need more step becaus it not enough to drew a conclus . not mani materi ar list .
334	1	0	0	piec of inform i would includ to replic the procedur would be to pour less vinegar in each contain let sampl sit and dry for min and leav sampl for hour . i choos that to see if anyth differ would happen to the mass then what happen to it the first time thei tri thi experi .
335	1	1	1	i would still want to know what thei were do thi experi how larg were the sampl and what wa us to measur the work sampl .
336	1	1	1	in order to creat do abl experi you would need to add a materi list describ the item need and how much of each . also independ and depend variabl and a hypothesi to back up your research .
337	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar should be pour into each of the four contain you should also know what the acid of the vinegar is so that you wouldn t us a stronger or weaker ph level . you would also need to know if you need to incub the contain so that their environ remain constant .
338	1	0	0	the addit inform you need to replac the experi . you need limeston wood and plastic marbl . you test all of them in differ contain . it will give you the mass of the experi . that is what it need to replac the experi .
339	1	0	0	how much of the materi did thei put into each contain . wa there a control part of thi experi . did thei conduct a graph for thi experi .
340	1	1	1	i would sai on piec of inform thei forgot wa the amount of vinegar thei put in each procedur .
341	1	3	3	in the procedur it would be best if thei said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the sampl and which sampl do you us in the sampl . final addit inform that should be ad would be tell where to keep these sampl where it s cold room or hot temperatur .
342	1	3	3	how much vinegar would you pour in each cup . what temperatur would the sampl be in would it be the same or would it be differ how would also need to know if thei us the same size cup . these thing ar all veri import inform that wasn t includ .
343	1	3	2	the addit inform that you would need in order to replic the experi would be what kind of contain do thei want us to us you would need a sampl of each of the substanc . as well as know what type of each substanc you need . last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the contain which chang the mass of each sampl .
344	1	3	3	some addit inform that i would need to replic thi experi would would be amount of vinegar size of the contain and the temperatur .
345	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi the amount of vinegar us in each separ contain must be known . also the type of contain is not specifi nor is the number of piec of the sampl that should be test state . all of these need to be known in order to replic the experi .
346	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi more inform is need . for exampl there ha to be clear statement of problem . thi procedur doesn t explain why thei were find out the mass of four differ sampl . also there ha to be inform on how much vinegar thei put in each contain that wai we can replic the experi .
347	1	1	1	the addit inform it would need would be the
348	1	0	0	to replic thi experi you would need to add what scale weight rock with . you will need a more detail procedur with a lot of step so what you can know what you have to do .
349	1	2	2	some inform that could be ad could be temperatur of the vinegar or water you could also add how much vinegar you add anoth thing to add would be a list of possibl sampl .
350	1	1	0	someth that the group would need to do in order to make the procedur better is make sure on step is alwai gather materi . thi insur that who ever ha to do the experi get everyth befor thei start . second make the set easier to understand step is veri hard to interpret . lastli make sure you clean up them at the end .
351	1	2	3	first i would need to know what thei us to determin the mass . it would also be help if thei put the differ kind of materi thei us in the actual experi procedur . in case there wa no data tabl present . thei could also more specif as to what exactli thei kept the sampl in and where thei put them . so i would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter . i would also need to no how much of each materi to us .
352	1	0	0	i believ that in order to replic we would need the design of the experi and when we
353	1	0	0	to replic their experi i would need to have take their their procedur and us them . i would also need their sampl from their procedur and then be capabl to copi their experi . all these need ar the true basic s .
354	1	1	1	to replic the experi there would need to be a control group which is what didn t receiv the treatment and in thi case didn t receiv the vinegar need to be more clear . it sai pour vinegar into a contain but it s not specif as to how much vinegar . also how much of the sampl that will be us isn t state .
355	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar you should distribut into the contain how long you should run theater on it for rins how much of the each materi you need .
356	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to know what the materi sampl were marbl limeston acid and plastic . you would also need to know the amount of vinegar that wa place in the cup and you would need to know what you ar weigh the mass in which is gram . if these three were ad to the procedur then you could replic the experi .
357	1	1	1	to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sampl .
358	1	0	0	to me i think that thi experi will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottl and give more exampl about what thei ar do to make thi experi work .
359	1	3	3	i would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cup as for as ml . where do i put the cup in the sun or ref rid after where do i let the sampl dry in the open or the outsid .
360	1	1	1	after read the group s procedur it state that you first need to determin the mass of the four differ sampl then pour vinegar in a contain and after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each with distil water . in order to replic thi experi i would have to know how much vinegar should be ad to each contain with the sampl .
361	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa put in each contain how much distil water each sampl wa wash with and the size of the contain .
362	1	3	3	after read the group procedur the addit inform i would need to replic the experi is what materi ar ar the differ sampl make of it is not list in the procedur how much vinegar should i pour in each contain more or less could affect how much mass ha end what shape the sampl were in in shape with there surfac we would have more contact with the vinegar end it right and the mass of the start materi if it wa to replic to experi or repeat the exactli i would need know how much of each sampl wa us .
363	1	2	2	to replic the experi it would put how much vinegar to pour on each contain . it would also put what effect of materi it go to us .
364	1	3	3	in order to replic thi procedur you would need to know
365	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know what the sampl were . also step three in their procedur is a littl confus and to replic thi experi thei mai want to give a littl bit more direct and be more specif . thei might also want to sai what size contain to us or how much vinegar to add to the contain to allow someon also to replic .
366	1	2	2	addit inform that would be need would be how much vinegar you pour in the separ contain . anoth thing that would be need is the type of rack becaus the gap didn t specifi the differ sampl in the procedur the group would also need to tell you what you ar us to determin the mass of the sampl befor and after for exampl thei could have said to measur it in gram .
367	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi after read you will need to know what the differ sampl ar . you will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain . you will have to rich what the measur is when you ar let it sit for the hour .
368	1	0	0	addit inform would be do the experi time befor put the data down .
369	1	2	2	i would need how much vinegar im put in the contain what kind of lime and plastic like where it came from and what kind of temperatur should the sampl dry in .
370	1	2	2	some addit inform that is need to replic thi experi is what ar the four differ sampl how much vinegar do you have to pour into each contain . and how mani trial ar need to get more accur data . we need those inform to know how to do thi experi .
371	1	0	0	my opinion is to not chang anyth becaus it seem alright it ha the sampl and the procedur present the tabl .
372	1	0	0	you need to repeat the the experi more time record all data then compar them to see of sampl have ani chang . also background inform is import to ani experi .
373	1	1	1	in order to repeat thi lab exactli as thei did i would need to know what materi i d need for exampl the marbl wood limeston plastic wa not write in the procedur .
374	1	0	0	in order for you to replic the experi you would have to chang the time usag to see if there would be a differ outcom . also in step where it sai to pour vinegar in each of the four contain chang how thei ar us vinegar and substitut it for anoth liquid to see if these would effect anyth . lastli i would suggest to us anoth sampl or as mani as possibl to get the most accur answer .
375	1	1	1	in thi procedur the group call the materi sampl instead of call them sampl thei should have name the materi like thei did in the chart . when thei just sai sampl that can mean anyth . in step number on thei should sai why you need to determin the mass of the four materi .
376	1	0	0	after you determin the mass of the product go back and see of your these wa correct . then go and eight a lab report about v . then when your done hand it in .
377	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi for acid rain you need addit inform . first you need to know what type of sampl your us . second the procedur did not specifi how big each sampl should be . have differ size might chang the result . lastli when rins the sampl under distil water you should know what temperatur to us veri hot or veri cold water might also chang the result .
378	1	2	2	the addit inform need to replic thi experi is the amount of vinegar pour on each of the sampl . also thei would need to includ a step in the begin that ask for the scientist to measur the mass of each sampl final thei would have to tell the scientist what type of contain to do the experi in whether thi wa the same for each sampl . these addit step detail would help creat accuraci consist for all who complet the experi .
379	1	1	1	i think on thing would be that we might need to know what the purpos of thi experi would be anther is thei didn t put in the procedur the name of materi we ar us and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measur the differ in mass .
380	1	1	1	some addit inform you would need to know is what sampl you have to place in the vinegar . in order to complet the investig you would need to know how to weigh the sampl and what to us to do it . you also have to do some math to get the differ in mass .
381	1	2	2	to repeat in experi do the group procedur i would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each contain . anoth inform
382	1	1	1	to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar us in each cup . i would also need to know the amount of distil water for their more explan must be better explain .
383	1	2	3	i would need to know how much sampl i need for thi experi . i would need to know how much vinegar i am pour into each contain . also i would need to know if i am let the sampl dry in the sun or not . without these i could not replic thi experi .
384	1	2	2	i would need to know how much vinegar wa us how big the contain ar and if each sampl should be the same mass .
385	1	0	0	more you could repeat the experi just see it .
386	1	1	1	first the experi need to have a control . thei need to put the materi in water to see if it ha ani affect on the materi . second thei need more than on trial for each materi . i suggest three so you receiv better data . the third thing thei can do is tell us exactli how much vinegar thei ar put into each sampl .
387	1	0	0	the limeston have mass than all of them .
388	1	0	0	you would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar distil water and some other materi .
389	1	2	3	in order to replic the experi the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain . you would also need to know if the start mass for each sampl should be the same . final you would need to know how and where to store the sampl dure the hour .
390	1	3	3	to replic thi experi we would need to know what type of sampl we ar determin the mass for . we would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup . we would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air dry . and we would need to know the mass of each materi befor the vinegar .
391	1	2	2	we would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup . also we would need to know how much or each sampl to us and which materi . we would also need a control . so would need to place someth in regular water as well .
392	1	1	1	thi experi didn t have a control and the grape didn t do multipl trifl . you would also mai need to know what temperatur the rome is .
393	1	3	2	you will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sampl . also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rins them .
394	1	1	1	some addit inform that need in thi experi acid rain would be explain more in detail about how to us the step ow also should explain what each materi is and lastli explain what sampl mean in differ wai . thi experi enoch be more clear and you should includ a grayish . thi experi doesnt make a whole lot of see five .
395	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi the type or sampl would need to be indic in the procedur in addit the size of the contain would need to be us . also the amount of materi place into each contain would need to be indic . lastli the amount of vinegar ad into the contain should be includ .
396	1	0	0	to replic thi experi you will need the follow vinegar to your in each ident contain you will need to let the sampl sit and dry for minut . after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water .
397	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would have to includ the measur of liquid to pour in each contain to identifi each of the sampl of deck you ar put in the contain and label the contain .
398	1	2	1	to replic the experi you would need to know how much of the sampl to put in each contain where thei store the contain for hour and where thei put each sampl when thei remov them from the contain and rins them with distil water and let the sit and dry for minut .
399	1	2	2	some addit inform would includ the amount of vinegar pour into each contain mass of the sampl taken and the temperatur where the contain were store for the hour .
400	1	2	2	the procedur should includ what the mass should be and how to get it . also you do not know what the four sampl ar . in the second step how much vinegar should be pour . in the that step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understand . a last step should also be includ to sai repeat .
401	1	1	2	after read the procedur i would need to know the materi the student ar us . i would also need to know why thei ar do the experi what is the purpos what kind of contain ar thei us and how big ar thei
402	1	2	2	addit inform that you would need in order to replic thi experi includ the amount of vinegar pour into each contain where the contain ar store or kept for hour how the sampl should be dri and lastli with what should the mass be taken on .
403	1	0	0	for on thing to replic the experi on would need to know how to determin the mass and the group must state how to do thi in their procedur . thei also should state to us the same mass object so that it is easi to replic . final the group should us a control to compar their result to and for replic of the experi .
404	1	0	0	you would need to state that wood didn t lose ani mass the plastic lost of mass the marbl lost of mass and the limeston lost . mass . then you would sai that limeston lose the most mass and wood lose the least mass .
405	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi there ar few addit piec of info thei should have includ . on thing should have includ is how rough vinegar thei pour into each contain . if there wa more vinegar in on contain then the other them on with more would lose mass readili . anoth thing thei would have includ is a control without a control there is noth to compar your result to . on last thing that is is necessari to repeat thi experi is you must know how much of each sampl that you us . if you us more of on sampl than anoth then of cours it is go to wai more . each sampl should be the same size .
406	1	2	3	the student should includ in their procedur what shape the sampl ar in ar thei all solid in the same shape or ar thei ground up the amount of surfac area will affect the rate of disintegr of the sampl . also thei should state how much vinegar should be put into the contain and that the amount of vinegar in each contain should be the same . what type of vinegar it is should also be includ .
407	1	0	0	a hypothesi wa need in thi experi . also the group should had told the reader what wa happen why the experi wa take place . also thei should had repeat the step at least three time to make sure the result where accur .
408	1	0	0	addit thing a i would need to replic thi experi is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the sampl sit and dry .
409	1	2	2	you would first want to know why thi experi wa be conduct what result where thei look for . you should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar wa be pour into the solut . equal mass of each solut as the start mass would also be
410	1	0	0	you would need . more trial . differ type of sampl and . mayb have have to sampl sit and dry for more than minut .
411	1	0	0	the addit info i would need to replic it is marbl limeston wood plastic water contain vinegar label .
412	1	2	2	the group would need sai what the four sampl ar in the procedur . thei need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each contain . the group also doe not tell you how to wai each sampl s mass .
413	1	0	0	limeston you would need becaus it s the most import of then it won t work when you us it .
414	1	0	0	thei need to repeat everi step that alreadi perform .
415	1	3	3	in order to replic thi group s procedur i would need the follow inform p . when thei sai in step on that thei need to determin the mass of four differ sampl thei should name and list the sampl that thei plan on us . p . in step two when thei sai to pour vinegar in each of the four separ but ident contain thei should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in . p . when thei sai in step four that we should rins each sampl with distil water how much water should we us and how long should we rins .
416	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sampl . you would also need to measur them at the exact time becaus the on you measur last might grow a littl more becaus it wa sit longer .
417	1	3	3	in order to replic the group student experi the addit inform i would need to endur how big the four ident contain were how big is sampl of each four materi that thei put into the contain where thei place the contain in a warm or cold environ . how much vinegar and the student pour into each contain .
418	1	1	1	the addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi ar the follow what chang had each sampl after sit hour . and the on would be what wa the exact amount of vinegar we pour in each four separ but equal contain how did and last what wa the outcom of thi investig . what did we learn
419	1	1	1	in order to replic the group s experi there is addit inform that would need to be known such as how much vinegar wa pour into the four separ contain how much of each sampl is us and what the group us in order to determin the mass of each sampl .
420	1	2	2	in order to do thi experi again you would need to know the exact mass of the sampl what kind of sampl thei ar and how long you have to rins the sampl for .
421	1	3	3	some addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi would be the amount of vinegar pour into each separ contain . if i did not have the data tabl i would also need to be told in the procedur what the four differ sampl ar . it would also be help to know what type of contain were us . in order to replic on experi the procedur must be precis and not have ani inform out or els the data mai come out complet differ and not be compar to the first set of data .
422	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the quantiti of the variabl sampl materi . it is necessari to know how the sampl were rins w distil water us . were thei put in a riff contain or just held under a steam of water mostli eva pol anti i need to know how thei determin the mass of the sampl what wa their tool of measur .
423	1	3	3	in order to repeat the experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa need in each contain how big each sampl should be and where to store the experi for hour so that the experi doe not get ruin due to the surround it wa in .
424	1	3	3	you would need a control to look back on you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each contain in with and get the time right . with the dai and stuff you would need to know all your materi .
425	1	0	0	what wa the purpos for them do thi experi p why did thei choos to set up there label thi wai p and for me to replic the procedur would be imposs due to the fact that there s no problem also there not a lot of inform provid that exampl the direct .
426	1	0	0	it doesn t tell you what thei ar try to figur out with the investig . so we would be abl to do the work but i would know what we did if for after .
427	1	1	1	if there is a control thei would need to identifi it thei should also tell the type of materi tell the mass unit of measur .
428	1	3	3	addit inform need in order to replic thi experi would be the amount of vinegar need to pour into each of the four separ contain . also the type of contain that that amount of vinegar should be place into . also although indic in the data tabl the student should put into their procedur the type of the four differ sampl and the start amount of each and what form thei ar in . should it be pour limeston a block of wood etc . and also thei should indic how much distil water to rins the sampl with at the end . all of these addit inform would be need in order to replic the experi .
429	1	0	0	you should in all procedur out in an actual experi .
430	1	1	1	on step that miss wa to gather all all the materi . anoth step that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup . anoth step thei might have to add as well is how much distil water that would be to on each europ .
431	1	0	0	in addit to thi experi the group should includ what thei would us to find the mass of these rock sampl .
432	1	0	0	after read the group procedur i think thei should have ad record the data get materi observ the experi and repeat experi .
433	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what the sampl ex perhap in the procedur ar without thi inform i could us noth as the sampl that get complet differ show .
434	1	1	1	i would write how much vinegar wa put into each of the test tube . also i would repeat the experi again to see if the inform that i have is accur and write why these is vinegar be ad to each of the four sampl .
435	1	0	0	thei should have said how much of each sampl thei put in each contain .
436	1	0	0	the addit inform that i would need is to add anoth independ variabl to the procedur other than vinegar to see if it ha the same effect on the sampl as well as the effect on vinegar . also to repeat the step more than onc to make sure that thei ar get the same inform as the first time . then we can come to the conclus and find that the vinegar ha more effect on limeston them the rest of the sampl .
437	1	1	1	after read the group s procedur some good addit inform would be what the contain ar made of the depend variabl and the depend variabl .
438	1	2	1	first off i d need to know mayb the materi of each sampl
439	1	2	2	in thi experi an addit format to perform the experi would be that the amount of vinegar is pour into the contain . thi mai effect the amount of mass lost for the sampl . i also think place them in certain place with differ temperatur effect how much the sampl would loos mass .
440	1	2	2	thi group is lack a control group in their procedur . also thei should have been more specif as to the size of the ident contain . next the group should have car vilifi what kind of sampl were need in step .
441	1	2	2	first i would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each contain . also i would need to know what the environ is the sampl store would be store in over the hour period . p lastli i would need to measur the mass of the four differ sampl and the volum of the liquid .
442	1	2	1	in order to replic thi experi you would first need to know how much volum or mm you would need to pour into the contain . also you would need to know how much specif you would need to rins the contain . noth b mess up in the experi . and step doe not explic how to d it doe the experi want the contain to have the same area it doe not explic .
443	1	2	2	there ar mani thing need in thi procedur in order for someon to replic it . first step sai determin the nose of four differ sampl . thei should have said what the sampl were of . second step sai pour vinegar but it doe not sai how much vinegar . third there is no control in thi experi . thei should have test each sampl with no vinegar for a control .
444	1	2	3	addit inform you would need in order to replic thi experi is how much vinegar to pour into each contain . it should sai what each sampl is in the procedur . a list of materi .
445	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how big sampl to us . you would also need to know the problem or what you were test for in the experi .
446	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the group s procedur would need to specifi what unit of measur to measur mass in g to specifi which sampl were be us marbl limeston wood of plastic . and specifi the size and type of the contain us beaker
447	1	1	1	addit inform need in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar wa pour into the four separ contain should i bui the materi or us natur resourc .
448	1	1	1	if i ha to replic the ex pigment i would need to know what type of sampl ar be us and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign . also how do you determin the mass .
449	1	3	3	thi inform need to be ad to the procedur in order to replic the experi p amount of vinegar pour p identifi type of sampl us in the procedur p temperatur and p size of contain open close lid
450	1	1	1	after read thi procedur i would advis these student to make step easier to understand . in order to replic thi experi you would need to label what materi is go into the contain what you re label it and what singl sampl enter the contain in the end . also to make thi experi more reliabl you would need to add more trial to your procedur . also if you were just look at your procedur and not the tabl you would need to identifi the four sampl in step on .
451	1	0	0	on thing thei should do is explain why thei ar test vinegar . also thei should have a hypothesi .
452	1	1	1	you would need to add materi that you need to us . you also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cup . you should also sai what you should label the contain with if it should be the sampl or letter like a b c d .
453	1	0	0	in order to find the start mass and end mass of the contain you would need to us some sect of measur materi like a scale to know the affect of vinegar on the materi you also need all start mass of materi to be the same mass .
454	1	3	3	to replic the experi you wood need to no what materi thei us for the experi . also you wood need to no how much vinegar thei put in each of the contain . final you wood need to no what size the contain is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is touch it .
455	1	1	1	in the first step the group need to be more precis on what thei ar sai for exampl the could sai determin the mass of differ rock sampl . i also think thei sai sampl too mani time . you get confus about what thei ar sai . on last piec of addit inform the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the contain .
456	1	0	0	where do you place the vinegar and where doe the marbl go in the experi . why do you need vinegar where doe the acid come from
457	1	0	0	after read thi group s procedur i think thei should have us more than four sampl so thei could find out differ sourc from other type of stone . also i think thei should have on more trial .
458	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i would first need to know how much vinegar wa pour into each contain so i don t put in too much or too littl . i would also need to know the size of the contain thei us becaus bigger or smaller contain could affect how the vinegar affect the sampl and lastli if i had onli look at the group s procedur i would need to know what four sampl the student us so that i could replic the experi . and then i would need to know where the contain were kept so i could give mine the same amount of light and other thing .
459	1	2	2	after read the group procedur i determin that in order to replic the experi addit inform is need . first the procedur doesn t state what is be test we need to know what specif sampl ar be refer to next we haven t been told how much of each sampl is requir in the individu contain . lastli we need to know how much vinegar is need in each contain .
460	1	0	0	the addit inform that would be need is determin the mass of four differ sampl which is the marbl limeston wood and plastic . the inform that is need is the start and end mass .
461	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi the group would have to list the differ mass sampl if not then a person might us ani differ mass sampl . also the group would have to list the control variabl such as the size of each weight sampl . lastli to replic thi experi the group would have to state how much vinegar thei ar put into each contain to make thi procedur replic abl the group would have to make these chang .
462	1	3	2	three piec of addit inform that i would need ar as follow . first how much vinegar ar thei pour in the contain secondli how larg should the sampl be the last thing i would want to know is what temperatur should the vinegar be .
463	1	1	1	to replic thi experi i would also need to know in step two how much vinegar to pour into each contain . otherwis you would not accur be abl to conduct thi experi .
464	1	3	3	after read the group s procedur in and for me to replic thi experi i would find need to know how much vinegar to be pour n each contain the size of each contain and how long each sampl is to be wash for . me know these three addit sourc of inform i could successfulli replic thi experi .
465	1	0	0	to replic the experi you mai want to know what the mass is when you take the sampl out of the contain in case the water ha an effect on it . also you can try do the experi for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better result . last you can let the sampl dry longer to see what happen to them .
466	1	3	3	you would need to know what the four differ sampl ar . also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain . lastli you need to know what temperatur to store them at .
467	1	3	3	the group s procedur wa pretti vagu there were no numer valu such as how much vinegar and how larg the sampl ar . also each sampl should be name in the procedur like determin the mass of marbl limeston wood and plastic sampl should be state in the procedur .
468	1	1	1	to repeat the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the contain you would us to know the purpos of the experi and what the differ is mass sai about the sampl .
469	1	3	3	just base off of the procedur you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain as it never a list then correct amount . you d also need to know what in us as a contain as some mai be too larg or small to get an accur result . you d also need to know the start mass of each sampl and what the sampl ar .
470	1	0	0	well you would need sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . three piec of inform limeston plastic marbl .
471	1	1	1	after read thi group procedur some addit inform thei would need to add to complet thi experi is first thei need to tell you correct measur such as how much vinegar to pour . also thei should tell you how to determin the mass of each sampl becaus there ar mani possibl wa you could find the temperatur or measur it etc . both of these observ should be ad to the produc in order to do the experi .
472	1	2	2	some addit inform is need to replic thi experi . first of all the student need to state exactli what four type of sampl to us in the experi marbl limeston wood and plastic . thei also need to state in the procedur the amount of vinegar and type of vinegar that need to be put in each cup . the procedur also need to state exactli how mani repeat trial with the remain sampl should be done and how mani extra sampl should be us for the repeat trial .
473	1	3	3	you would also need to know what kind of object you us for each materi for exampl plastic could
474	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know some background inform on how much acid rain across each sampl . anoth piec of inform need would be is how much vinegar wa pour into the separ ident contain . a third piec of inform need in order to replic thi experi is how the gram measur were taken us thei taken us a gram soak all of these thing ar need in order to be abl to replic thi experi .
475	1	1	1	inform i would need p what do thei want to find out in other word their impli aim . p the amount of vinegar . p the amount of sampl .
476	1	2	2	to be abl to redo thi experi the group of student should have told you more thing . for exampl do thei want us to us the same materi of cours thei do so that s on . anoth is what kind of contain do thei want us us we can us plastic or metal or anoth . lastli you would need to know how much distil water that you need .
477	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi we would need to know how much vinegar the peopl us . if we don t know and we us more or less it could chang the experi outcom . also we would need to know all of the tool thei us so that we could us the same on . and final it would help if thei measur the mass in between the hour .
478	1	1	1	on addit inform you would need to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar in ml is need to pour into the contain . everi contain need the same amount of vinegar . the other addit inform need is the fact that the differ in mass ha to be determin or els you would miss the point . the third addit inform need is what to measur the sampl with and what unit thei need to be measur in . thei all need the same unit and balanc .
479	1	2	2	to repeat thi experi i would need to know what the four sampl were and how wide the contain should be .
480	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi we would need to know the size of the contain the amount of vinegar and the temperatur of the vinegar without thi inform the experi cannot be replic .
481	1	1	1	what thei miss wa the sampl that thei were pour the vinegar on . thei need to have everi piec of inform in the procedur . so other peopl can do thi job .
482	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar did thei put in each sampl so you can get the exact amount of end mass becaus if we put a differ amount we re go to get a differ result .
483	1	2	2	on thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each contain . also which sampl ar thei us and also how much of the sampl should u us . for exampl the whole object half the object . also if thei were make a tabl what inform do u need to record .

560	1	1	1	the addit inform you would need is to describ the four sampl you ar us becaus it doesn t sai which sampl to us in the procedur . you would also need to know to determin the differ in mass becaus the procedur onli tell you to find the start and end mass . you would also need the sampl to dry for more than minut to get better result becaus the origin result didn t have a larg differ in mass .
561	1	1	1	in step on thei could tell you the differ sampl so that you could know what thei ar in step three thei should tell you the amount os materi that you should place in each contain . after step number six it should sai record data and repeat if need .
562	1	1	1	there is someth miss . in the procedur it sai to pour vinegar into the contain . what it fail to mention is how much vinegar to pour into each contain . without thi the experi is imposs to replic becaus the independ variabl would be the amount of vinegar ad but there is no mention of how much to add
563	1	2	2	i would need to know what to measur the weight in how much vinegar to put in and how long to rins each sampl with distil water for .
564	1	1	1	while i would need to know how much to put in each contain and were to put these item from and the fact were thi could be done at in or out door . how to get the starter mass of each sampl . between the starter and end of the investig how mani time do you check it .
565	1	3	3	if you wish to replic the experi thei would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is need doe the sampl need to rest on a trai or on a paper towel and tell the size of each of the sampl .

568	1	2	2	step on realli should go at the end . you need to state the amount of vinegar that goe into the contain . tell us the name of the element along with the amount be test . tell which sampl to begin the experi with and what to label it . i would need to know how to determin the mass of the sampl and make a graph .
569	1	1	0	in order to adequ replic thi experi on would need more specif sampl for exampl instead of wood it should be a specif type of wood marbl limeston or plastic . the procedur should also be clearer concern how to us the vinegar in relat to the sampl condit to remov such sampl from the vinegar after hour .
570	1	1	1	you would need the independ variabl that never chang . to replic the experi would need to no exactli how much of the vinegar wa pour into each of the four contain . also how did the mass react to the substanc .
571	1	1	1	on thing you would need to know to complet thi experi is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar . and lastli how long ar you keep these sampl in vinegar for dai week it never tell you thi inform it would be much more accur if we knew those follow thing .
572	1	0	0	first off you would need more sampl of the rock to put in the rain . also to replic the experi you would need to new to state the next dai try the experi all over again . the person replic it would also have to wait a whole other hour . more water and vinegar would be need too .
573	1	2	2	to replic the experi the student need to includ more detail in their procedur . first we need to know what ar good sampl to us for thi experi . the student tell us to pour vinegar into contain howev it is not clear how much vinegar to us if the amount of vinegar ar differ the entir experi will not be accur . to improv the experi the student could have done more trial to get better observ .
574	1	0	0	i would need to know how
575	1	1	1	on thing thei should includ is how much vinegar thei need in each cup so you can measur be the same in all the contain .
576	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi i need to know how much vinegar did the group of student pour in the ident contain i need to know how much vinegar the student pour becaus it realli import becaus mayb the student pour less vinegar in on cup and pour more in the other .
577	1	3	2	addit inform i would need to replic the experi is to whether i should leav the sampl in a dark or light area for the hour time period . also i would need to know if i should leav the sampl at room temperatur or a cooler area . i would also need to know how much vinegar should us it doesn t state it clearli .
578	1	3	3	you would need to know that the vinegar is the substanc that is be us for the acid rain . you would also need to know what type of materi you need . anoth piec of need inform is how much vinegar to pour into each contain becaus the more vinegar ad the stronger it mai becom and therefor the vinegar would be abl to eat awai at the sampl more . you would also need to know where the contain were place for the hour whether thei were place at cool temperatur hot or cold .
579	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain you would also need to know what sampl of what materi you must place in each contain . you need to know the differ sampl what to do with the differ in mass what do the differ in the mass s tell you
580	1	0	0	thi procedur of acid rain tell about the start mass in gram . thei gave four differ sampl but thei didn t includ a explan wai thei were put acid rain on the sampl . the purpos of thi experi is to show the start mass end mass and the differ in mass i gram and it wa compar to the differ sampl .
581	1	1	1	first off thei dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the contain also that thei should have ad control or just water to have sampl to confound and do .
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedur need to specif measur the second thing it need to identifi each materi . and the third thing is thei need a control .
583	1	1	1	to replic the experi you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cup .
584	1	1	1	you would need to have a control group in order to have the accur mass of the sampl . also place the same amount of vinegar and water into each contain allow student to record the correct data .

600	1	1	1	what ar the four sampl ar what kind of materi you would need ar go out a hypothesi .
601	1	2	2	to replic the experi i would need to know what four differ sampl to us to determin the mass how much vinegar do i pour in each of the four sampl and am i do all four at the same time . so thei ar take out in hour at the same time .
602	1	2	2	in order for me to replic thi group experi i need to know what type of sampl am i weigh . i need to know how much vinegar am i pour in the contain . i also need to know what i am label on contain and what wa i us to remov sampl from the contain .
603	1	3	3	some addit inform that you would need in order to replic thi experi ar how much vinegar to put into each contain the size of the materi and what kind of contain the sampl and vinegar ar be put into these thing would make veri experi as close as possibl to the group s .
604	1	2	2	you would need sever thing in addit to replic thi experi . on would be how much vinegar to pour into the contain . anoth would be if all the contain got the same amount of vinegar or do thei differ . a third piec of inform need would be what sampl to us . also if thei should all start out with the same mass or not .
605	1	2	2	the addit inform that is necessari is how much vinegar you need to put in the contain . i also think you need to know how much of the sampl you put in the contain . where do you let the sampl sit for hour insid outsid by a window
606	1	2	2	on piec of addit inform need in the procedur would be how much vinegar to pour in the contain . anoth piec of inform would be how much distil water is need to rins the sampl . also anoth piec of inform miss would what ar the four sampl you would be test .
607	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sampl is equal . i would also need to know the locat of where the contain should be put dure the hour ex shade sun . lastli i would need to know what kind of contain should be us a plastic a cover or a dark contain etc .
608	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi on would need to know what the sampl wa a desir rang in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solut vinegar that should be appli for each sampl have a larg rang and an equal amount of solut compromis the valid
609	1	1	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what the differ materi ar that i d be test . in addit i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that need to be pour on each sampl . final i would need to know that i wa find the differ in the mass from start to finish for each of the sampl . otherwis i would be miss my depend variabl
610	1	0	0	to replic the experi you ar need to divid the differ substanc add more vinegar to each contain add more distil water have them sit for hour for about minut mass them and see how thei wash .
611	1	2	2	you need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the contain will chang littl .
612	1	2	2	. have a determin size for the start sampl of rock . p . determin an amount of vinegar . p . determin what type of contain ar be us .
613	1	0	0	you will need to know which rock had the most mass which on had the least and which on wa the same .
614	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the procedur need to includ how much vinegar is go to be pour in the contain how much water you rins the contain with where it is be dri and how to measur the mass gram wound etc .
615	1	2	2	i would includ the materi us or the sampl . also thei should includ in the procedur the type of measur thei ar do make and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup .
616	1	3	3	addit inform that you would need for thi experi would be how much vinegar to put in how big the contain should be and if the materi should be or shouldn t be fulli submerg by the vinegar .
617	1	2	2	on piec of inform is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experi . you also need to know what you re suppos to do with the data after you have collect it to find the answer to your problem . it doesn t sai in the procedur to analyz the data or anyth like that .
618	1	1	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sampl . i would also need to know what the control of the experi wa so i could compar result of the sampl . lastli i would need to know if the experi wa complet .
619	1	1	1	includ the name of the sampl in the procedur . p sai how do student measur the mass . p ask student to object at the data and drawn conclus .
620	1	1	1	the procedur never state what the sampl ar . it need to add the four sampl marbl limeston wood and plastic into the first step . the procedur need to state in the first step that the start mass i be measur and in the th step that the end mass is be measur . the procedur also need to add a step to tell the experiment to determin the differ in mass from the start and end mass
621	1	0	0	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know what the student ar look for why each step of the procedur is be done why those four sampl were chosen and if there should be more trial or repetit in order to creat more accur data .
622	1	0	0	the addit inform you will need to replic thi experi is how much more of the need sampl you need how much time you will need to go through with the procedur and what your start mass need to be .
623	1	2	2	after read the group procedur there wa addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi . first thei didn t state how much vinegar to pour into the contain which is a huge factor . second in order to make sure their experi wa valid thei could have done anoth trial and lastli thei should state the temperatur thi is all happen at becaus that could have an effect on the result .
624	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four differ sampl . the second thing you need to know is what temperatur the room is when you start the experi . the last step is write a group and write the conclus of your experi record .
625	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi the group would need some addit inform in their procedur . an exampl would be how thi group determin the mass of the substanc . thei need specif like how much vinegar thei need in each contain or how big the sampl is or what the sampl is . it s veri vagu so thei should add more specif .
626	1	0	0	i would need to know what the purpos of me do the experi would be and what exactli wa i try to find in order to replic the experi .
627	1	3	3	to replic thi experi some more inform that could be us would be to sai in the procedur what amount of vinegar to us for all cup . thi would make a huge impact on the experi outcom . also includ the size of the contain to us and the unit to measur the mass of the sampl . sai what sampl to us in the experi too .
628	1	2	2	to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar wa to be ad to to the four separ contain . even though the sampl ar list in the chart the group drew the name of the sampl should be in the procedur .
629	1	2	2	the group fail to identifi how much vinegar you should pour into each contain what to label the contain or what materi to put in the contain . thei also forgot to includ safeti procedur and did not tell you to measur the differ in or mass to carri the small .
630	1	2	2	after read the group procedur i think that in order to replic these experi i will need to know what type of contain and about how much vinegar to put into the contain .
631	1	2	2	the addit inform that thi experi need ar the amount of vinegar to pour in each contain and sai exactli what four sampl you ar us . you need to have these thing sin an experi becaus if you don t then you wouldn t know what you ar experi and what is make that chang . you also need a control group .
632	1	3	3	to tell me what the sampl ar in the procedur . p how much vinegar to pour in the four contain . p where and at what temperatur ar thei put them in .
633	1	2	2	the biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experi invalid . anoth problem is that thei didn t mention how much vinegar should be us . the group wasn t veri specif for exampl thei didn t sai what temp . the sampl should be kept at . by not mention constant and leav out the control their experi would be invalid .
634	1	0	0	after you remov the contain you rins them see what result you get in about so minut .
635	1	1	1	you would need to know the condit of the sampl p you would need to know what type of plastic becaus their ar so mani differ plastic . p you would need to know what type of wood becaus their ar so mani differ type . p you would also want to know the acid level of their particular vinegar .
636	1	1	1	to be abl to replic the experi you would need to know the sampl you ar experi with . although the sampl ar list in the data shown below the procedur it doesn t show the sampl in the procedur and if i wa to do the experi without the other group data there is no wai i could without know the sampl .
637	1	0	0	i would need vinegar contain label time hour a sink minut for them to dry and a tripl beam balanc scale .
638	1	3	3	a person try to replic thi experi would need to know what type of contain to put the sampl in how much vinegar should be ad at the temperatur that the contain should be kept under . all of these would be inform a person try to replic the experi would need to know .
639	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi the inform that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sampl . also i would need to know what type of vinegar to us and do i put the sampl in a ref regal tar or leav them at room temperatur .
640	1	2	2	after read the group i would need to know what materi to be us dure thi experi . i would also need to know what kind of scale to us to determin the mass of the object also what kind of contain to us .
641	1	0	0	i would need to know what wa happen to the sampl dure that hour . i would need to know why thei chose the four sampl that thei did . . i would also need glove and a mask to protect myself .
642	1	1	1	on idea thei might need to us is to sai what four materi sai stone ar be us in your procedur . also thei should be sure to us a control in thi experi miss . the group should also us more than on trial to their experi lab .
643	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each contain so the result ar accur . you would need to know how big each sampl wa you would also need to know what temperatur thi experi wa done at .
644	1	1	1	in my experi i would includ step p . gather materi . p . observ of the substanc . p . make sure no particl were lost in the rins of water .
645	1	2	1	to repeat thi experi i would need to knew how vinegar what is the control and what ar the sampl .
646	1	2	2	the group will need
647	1	3	3	if i were to replic thi experi i would need to know the follow thing that the student left out of their procedur p . how big should the rock sampl be p should thei be rel the same size p . how much vinegar should be pour into the contain p . how long should the sampl be rins with distil water p . should the contain be made out of ani specif materi
648	1	3	3	if i were to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour what temperatur to keep the experi anoth vinegar and what temperatur to keep the experi dry .
649	1	3	2	i would need to know how much vinegar that wa us in each of the four contain . i would need to know what the four contain contain sinc thei ar the sampl be us in the experi . and what to us to determin the mass of them .
650	1	0	0	to replic the experi you will need all the sampl and how you will need more acid rain .
651	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what type of sampl you should you should be us how much vinegar you should put in each contain and you would also need to know how to separ the sampl from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be includ when final weigh the end mass of the sampl .
652	1	2	2	the person do the experi would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into the contain what type of contain thei us . plastic metal glass etc whether or not the person would need glove tong and other utensil . you will also need a three beam scale to measur your materi befor and after .
653	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup . differ amount of vinegar would add anoth variabl to the experi compromis the result .
654	1	2	2	addit inform you would need to in order to replic the experi would be how much vinegar you pour the ph level of th vinegar and much of the sampl wa ad into the vinegar .
655	1	2	3	to replic the experi i would need the materi to replic the procedur i would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the contain . to replic the experi would need to know where to place the contain with the vinegar and materi in it .
656	1	3	3	i would need to know what the sampl were of how much vinegar what contain what materi how much of that materi .
657	1	2	2	i would need a measur of how much vinegar went into each contain . i also would need to know how mani trial were their . in addit i would need to know what type of vinegar wa us .
658	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i would need to know how much acid rain is us in the four sampl . i would also need to know the measur of vinegar pour into each of the contain . and what temperatur ar the sampl kept at for contain amount of time and how long for each time period .
659	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain . also you would need to how to determin mass . not to mention you would need to know in what temperatur would need to leav the sampl to dry .
660	1	0	0	after read the group s procedur thei would need these four sampl thei need need to put down what there procedur is about .
661	1	1	1	thei could have told us the amount of vinegar us what thei us to make the distil water and the could have explain how to rins the materi . i we should look it in the water for a few second or just rins them .
662	1	2	2	the group of student investig acid rain ar miss sever piec of vital inform so the data qua nativ data is record such as start mass sit mass and differ in mass unserturetli onli on type of qua activ data is record the sampl type leg in a get the contain and angri type ar not thi caus type as differ type of vinegar have differ level of acid concentr the p cup brand plai a less signific role but when try to replic an experi the materi and procedur have to be as close to the origin as possibl .
663	1	1	1	to replic the experi i would need to know the deadli of vinegar us with each materi . i would also need to know what kind of plastic thei us in the expens becaus there ar mani differ
664	1	2	2	these other piec of inform that i would need in order to replic thi experi as ar what do i obtain marbl limeston wood and plastic . sinc there as the of materi
665	1	1	2	in order to replic the group s experi you would need to know some addit inform to the procedur given . on of these piec of inform is how the group determin the case of the sampl . wa it with a tripl balanc scale etc . anoth piec of inform explain is how long each sampl wa . final in order to replic the experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar us .
666	1	1	1	addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar to put in the differ sampl what the constant variabl is and how to determin the mass of each sampl .
667	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what kind of contain to us how much vinegar and
668	1	0	0	on would need to find out witch sampl is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them . try to find out witch on can be is acid rain and not loss ani mass and tell them you think thi had happen in an if the becaus sentenc .
669	1	0	0	my first piec of inform would be a bar graph then i would give specif direct on what i did . but i would make it clear so other peopl can easili do it to . then i would write a conclus why thi ralli happen .
670	1	0	0	i would write what
671	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi there is quit a few other piec of info that thei need . first you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sampl . secondli you need to know how much of each sampl you need . final you need to know the mass of the cup so you don t mix up the sampl weight . that s the inform you need to replic thi experi .
672	1	2	2	it should sai how much vinegar thei us in each contain it should sai in the procedur what the sampl ar that thei ar us . each sampl of the materi thei were us should have the same start mass and same amount of vinegar should be us in each .
673	1	2	1	to replic the experi you would need to add as the first step gather all materi . in step two thei should tell the amount of vinegar that wa us . step six should be chang to after allow each sampl to dry determin the mass .
674	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sampl . differ amount of vinegar would give differ result . you d also need to know what to determin the mass with and what materi were us .
675	1	1	1	i would need to know what kind of instrument thei us in order to determin the mass i would need to know what sampl materi i m us in the procedur and i would need to know how mani trial i would need to do .
676	1	0	0	you will need a solut result and a conclus .
677	1	3	3	from thi experi i would need to know how big each of the contain ar i would also like to know how much vinegar wa place in each contain if i wa to replic thi experi . i would also need to know how long to rins off the sampl with distil water after thi ha been remov from their contain .
678	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i would have to know how much vinegar to poor . i would have to know what and of sampl to us .
679	1	0	0	the addit inform that thei would need in order to replic the experi is a sampl of on materi into on contain and label . repeat with with remain sampl place a singl sampl into a contain . after hour remov the sampl and allow sampl to sit and dry . the addit inform that would be need is the start mass the end and the differ .
680	1	0	0	you would need to add the type of solut the stone on go in .
681	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi the group s procedur should includ more specif inform . thei should includ the name of the substanc that thei ar us for sampl . thei should also add an exact amount of the four sampl and exactli how each contain should be label . thi will make the procedur easier to follow . it would also help to know how much vinegar should be pour in the contain .
682	1	0	0	on addit piec of inform that thei did not add in the procedur wa to determin the chang in mass from befor and after the experi . also between step and there need to be a step to put the sampl in the separ but ident contain .
683	1	2	2	how much vinegar is need in each dish . what is the sampl materi . and how do you determin the mass .
684	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need the size the four contain ar what the student us to measur the mass and how thei got the answer of what the mass is . and how much vinegar the student pour into each contain .
685	1	2	2	after read the group experi i believ that thei will need multipl trial thei also need a control . what type of contain how much vinegar . also what you would us to find the mass .
686	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to know a control the re pictur to keep the contain at and you need to know how much vinegar .
687	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi inform would have to be ad to the procedur . i would need to know how much vinegar wa put to each of the contain so that i can make sure some of them get the same amount . also i would need to know how to determin the mass of the four differ sampl by us a balanc or scale etc . final i would need to know if the contain were close or not becaus that environment factor could chang the result of an my their experi .
688	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would first need to know the exact measur of vinegar thei us . second thei would need to tell us the order in which thei place each materi into the vinegar . lastli to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of time that you rins each materi . so the all came out equal . you would need to know all of these step becaus otherwis thei could be enabl alter the result of the experi .
689	1	3	3	to replic thi i would need much more inform as to size of sampl . also there should be more specif size measur of the contain . lastli thei never sai how much vinegar to us . p all of these ar import to be abl to replic the experi .
690	1	0	0	accord to the data that the student record the start mass had higher level the end had some other high and low level and the differ on mass had some law number out an order to replic the experi i would never background hypothesi graft conclus problem materi i think that what i will need in order to replic the experi .
691	1	1	2	the three sampl of inform would need to replic the experi ar measur of the amount of vinegar the materi you would need to us and purpos of the experi .
692	1	3	3	the procedur is unclear . in order to effect replic thi experi . i would need to know what the four sampl that ar need were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . it would help to know how larg each contain wa as well . p . vinegar amount . . type of sampl . . contain size .
693	1	2	2	the first piec of inform need would be how much vinegar ha to be us in the contain . how much distil water ha to be us to wash them and doe the contain need to do the present excis
694	1	2	0	you have to make sure that you ar veri specif when write a procedur . some addition need inform would be in step what measur ar you have the mass in g kg . in step you need to give a precis amount that you ar put in the contain . for exampl ml . anoth thing is in step what ar you label the cup sai you need to specifi . lastli in step you need to put a measur of what mass is to be calcul in .
695	1	0	1	after read the group procedur addit inform is would need in order to replic the experi is choos differ sampl to work with . instead of pour vinegar onto the sampl us anoth liquid form . and final instead of let the sampl sit and dry for min you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than min .
696	1	1	2	after read the group s procedur the addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is how i can determin the mass . the materi i am work with . how ident the contain have to be .

698	1	1	0	to repeat thi experi you would need a list of materi .
699	1	1	1	in step of sai to pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident contain .
700	1	3	3	some addit inform i would need is i would need to know how much vinegar t put into the contain . i would also need to know what the sampl ar . to replic the experi i would need to know where to put the contain weather it be in the same room temperatur or anywher els .
701	1	3	3	to replic thi i need to know what sampl i m work with . it doesn t tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cup . if sai after hour remov sampl from the contain where do thei go for hour
702	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi it is ne sherri to know what materi will be us no sampl . to the differ sampl were list in the procedur it would be better understand . it would also be us to state the purpos of the experi which is to record vinegar s effect on the mass of the sampl . it would also be necessari to sai how much vinegar should be ad in each contain .
703	1	1	1	the addit inform i would need is how to determin the mass of four differ sampl . it is well specifi . also i need to know how much vinegar to pour into differ contain then after the experi is complet i would need to figur out how to determin the mass of the sampl .
704	1	3	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each ident contain . the four differ sampl mass of them and where thei were put is state . but not how much vinegar wa put into the contain .
705	1	1	1	to replic the experi you would need to find out exactli what sampl were test in thi case . the sampl ar marbl limeston wood and plastic . you would need to find out when the experi wa be conduct and whose you re test .
706	1	3	3	i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain and what type of vinegar to us . also thei do not state what the four differ sampl ar in their procedur which could caus confus .
707	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know mani detail . first i would need to know what sampl i am us in order to find their mass . i also would need to know how larg each materi is . thi wai i can perform an accur best becaus i would know how larg the materi wa . also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cup so that each materi receiv the same amount . last i would need to know how to rins each materi so that thei all receiv the same amount of water .
708	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi the group s procedur would need to includ what each of the differ sampl were determin how much vinegar would be us in each contain and it should state the condit the sampl would be in for exampl the temp . of the room .
709	1	1	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each contain you would also need to know how much sampl exactli do you have to put in each contain the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sampl .
710	1	3	3	you would need to know the amount of vinegar need the type of contain and the amount of time to rins each sampl with water .
711	1	0	0	the addit inform you would need wa on wa the best marbl limeston wood and plastic .
712	1	3	3	at the start of the procedur we would need to know what four sampl we were test . otherwis we mai test materi not even associ with the experi . we also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the contain . we final would also need to know what kind of contain we would put the sampl in plastic glass we need to know thi as well .
713	1	3	3	addit inform need to replic thi experi would be to give the sampl and how much of the sampl were us in the procedur . also the amount of vinegar and the size of the contain us should be given .
714	1	0	0	thi experi should includ an explan of why student were do thi experi . thei should tell us why the mass decreas and why the wood keep the same mass .
715	1	2	2	three piec of inform need in order to replic the experi is . to know how much vinegar to us . what is the control if ani and . do you cover the sampl over the hr period or do you just leav them uncov
716	1	1	1	if thi experi wa go to be repeat a control would need to be us . instead of us vinegar the materi would be place in water . also the procedur doe not clearli state how much vinegar is us on each materi . the amount should be equal to balanc it out . chang the amount of time the sampl sit insid the contain could also chang the result of the experi .
717	1	1	1	some addit inform you would need is what sampl there put in . thei need a a hypothesi show what conclus for the hypothesi .
718	1	2	1	to make thi experi more accur and the no to replic it i would need to the near of the differ sampl in seat . ar what ar it materi contain can t in step . and final i would need to know what to measur the sampl with what kind of unit .
719	1	1	1	i would write down how much vinegar thei put in these differ exampl of mass . thei didn t keep track of the experi . p thei also didn t repeat the experi again and i think that on of the most import thing that everybodi should do .
720	1	1	1	i think thei should also put why ar thei do it i mean what is the main idea of it becaus just to sai thei ar try to determin the mass of four differ sampl like the temperatur volum how to the sampl in a determin place etc .
721	1	1	1	addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi would includ control such as how much of amount of vinegar is need in step you would also need a specif or a set amount of each sampl to move the result have mean inform costli you would need to make trial in the experi to make sure the result ar valid .
722	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the scientist need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in also at kind of contain the label s titl and the devic us to measur the mass .
723	1	0	0	how much do you pour in the contain .
724	1	0	0	thei also should watch how all the sampl chang and take note . see if ani of them dry slower then other or faster and why might thei . then see how it chang dure the dai .
725	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi you should measur the amount of vinegar ad in each contain . you should also measur the mass of each sampl befor ad them to the vinegar . lastli you should measur the amount of vinegar left after the materi is taken out .
726	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi you also need to know what type of sampl materi will be more how much of each sampl materi need and how much vinegar you should pour into each contain . by have thi inform the lab will be more accur and correct .
727	1	1	1	the addit inform that is prefer requir is how mani drop of vinegar which mai have repres acid rain with a p . h of . wa put into each sampl sinc p there were differ mass of the given sampl leg . marbl . g wherea wood . g . p the end mass mai or mai not have decreas in a major differ depend on how much vinegar wa instil . p the mass of the differ sampl should be the same acquir togeth with the same amount of vinegar us just look for the best sampl that could resist acid
728	1	3	3	after read thi procedur i have notic that i would need to know the ph of the vinegar . also i would need to know how much vinegar is need . lastli it is import to know what kind of cup thei ar us becaus thei could have a chemic that rube off on the sampl make the result differ .
729	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi thei should sai what temperatur to keep the room at thei should also sai exactli how much vinegar to put in each contain becaus that would chang the result . and also thei should includ a specif amount of how much of the sampl to put in becaus if on sampl is bigger than anoth that will also chang the result .
730	1	2	2	in order to replic the group s experi i would need to know the sampl be us how much vinegar to us and also what to label . without thi inform it would be veri difficult to replic the experi with just us their procedur becaus it is not specif enough and doesn t includ all the inform need .
731	1	2	2	the student should state what the four differ sampl ar state how much vinegar should be us in each sampl contain . also there should be safeti procedur so that no on get vinegar in their ey .
732	1	2	2	three addit inform that is need to replic the experi ar how much vinegar is need to be pour how long do you rins the contain for . what do you measur the mass in
733	1	2	2	in order to replic thi lab experi you would need to know what the name of the four differ sampl ar . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four contain so there is an even amount in each contain . anoth thing you would need to know when replic thi experi is what you ar us to find the mass .
734	1	2	2	i would need to know what kind of sampl to us how much vinegar to put on the sampl and how to label the contain to replic the experi .
735	1	0	0	in order need sai the inform .
736	1	1	0	pour the same amount of vinegar on all four . after you determin the mass of all four sampl find out the differ of each from first time you did it .
737	1	1	1	after read the group s procedur in order to replic the experi thei would first have to be more specif and tell what the sampl had to be . that is the onli thing thei would need to do .
738	1	1	1	the student didnt start with sai what materi ar need . thei also didnt sai what the four sampl were . the student did specifi on what kind of materi thei were us
739	1	1	0	as you can see the student investig went well . the materi thei us were marbl limeston wood and plastic . by look of the data you can see that the start mass for all of them is marbl limeston wood plastic . then the end mass read marbl limeston wood and plastic . as you can see all of them escap limeston decreas . as you can see the investig took a lot of time to put togeth . so i believ as i have laid out for you that thi investig took a lot of time and thei came out with wonder result .
740	1	3	3	after read the group s procedur i have determin thei could add what four differ sampl you ar us dure the experi . the group should also be specif with the amount of vinegar that should be pour into each contain . the temperatur at which the sampl ar to dry for min should be regul becaus if it is too hot or too cold the experi could be ruin .
741	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi the group would need to most importantli state what the experi is for name the materi us and a hypothesi for the experi .
742	1	0	0	for the inform you would need all three piec to describ the addit inform which is start mass end mass and the differ in mass . the item ar marbl limeston wood and plastic . then write all the number down to replic the experi .
743	1	0	0	i will need to add the vinegar in each of four separ and . hour i remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water and after i determin the mass of each sampl .
744	1	3	3	addit inform i would need to replic thi experi would be the amount of vinegar need to pour into the contain the size of the contain themselv and how long i would rins the sampl with distil water after the sampl ar remov from the vinegar .
745	1	2	3	thei should add how much vinegar to pour into the contain and how larg the contain must be as well . anoth thing thei might want to add is the concentr of vinegar that is pour in whether or or someth els to find mass you would also need to find volum .
746	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i will need to sai that list what will be the materi go insid the contain . p i will also have to add in water what will have to be four differ sampl . identifi how much amount of vinegar will the contain have becaus thi will affect the of the materi .
747	1	3	3	you need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain what and of contain to us and whether to react the sampl or not .
748	1	2	2	the addit inform that is need to replic thi experi is the amount of vinegar that is need in each contain . and also the site of the contain need for thi experi .
749	1	2	2	thei should sai how much vinegar to pour into each individu contain . thei should also tell how much of the sampl thei need to pour into the label contain . thei need to tell the temperatur at which the sampl ar kept at for hour . also the temperatur at which the sampl sit an dry for minut .
750	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know a saw thing . i would need to know how much vinegar thei us what kind of contain and how big it is and what kind of vinegar wa us .
751	1	2	1	how much vinegar do you us for each cup of sampl . thei should have said how much water to rins each sampl with also could you try differ liquid .
752	1	0	0	take an hypothesi of what mass thei ll have analyz your result and make a conclus to the problem .
753	1	2	2	the addit inform that i would need to replic the experi the amount of vinegar place in each cup i would also need to know how much each cup weigh by itself . i would need to know how big each undivid
754	1	2	3	the student left out some import inform in the procedur like how much vinegar should be put into the cup . if we were to replic the experi we would not have the student data tabl so how much of what sampl do we need to conduct the experi . where should the sampl dry warm cold in the sun
755	1	0	0	packet in fat it don t make no sens .
756	1	2	2	to replic the student experi you would need too find out how much vinegar too us for the contain . you would also need to how big of contain to us and you need to have more than on teal for each of the sediment to us .
757	1	1	1	some addit inform would be to have a control test with vinegar but stick with
758	1	3	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need a hypothesi the materi that ar need and the measur of liquid i would need . i would do the experi the same wai so i would also need to know what kind of contain to us . i would also need to know at what time the experi start and end .
759	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi from the procedur what the four sampl ar must be includ . in step the size of the contain must be includ . for step the unit be us us to be state .
760	1	1	1	the addit info that you need is a control how much vinegar you ar ad and how much of the materi is us .
761	1	1	1	the first thing that thei ar miss is the amount of vinegar . thei didn t go into enough detail on what their experi is about .
762	1	2	3	i would need to know how much of each materi will be need . also i will need to know how larg or small the contain will have to be for the end result to be ident . lastli i must know where the contain were place in the sun shade etc . or my result mai vari .
763	1	2	2	addit inform that you would need ar the amount of vinegar that you pour into the sampl the temperatur which you take the experi and the effici of experi . p vinegar affect the mass of sampl when it go insid absorb . p temperatur affect evapor . p effici when do experi you must have thi measur of some condit .
764	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the contain . that would ensur that the differ in mass of the rock wa becaus of the rock and not the amount of vinegar . also i mai need to know what type of rock to us in the procedur list .
765	1	0	0	the addit inform i would add would be to record the data at the end of the procedur . find the averag of the sampl . to find the differ in the object that were place in the contain .

768	1	1	1	in the procedur the group of student said to pour vinegar in each of four contain . howev the student fail to state how much vinegar should be ad . by not do so on could try the experi as the procedur sai to but mai get differ result becaus the amount of vinegar that he or she us mai be differ from the student amount . also there need to three trial of each of the sampl and a clear explan as to how the mass of the sampl wa found .
769	1	2	2	you would need to know how much wood limeston marbl and plastic you would need . also how much vinegar to put in the contain . how long do you rins the sampl under the distil water those ar the inform that you would need to do thi experi .
770	1	2	2	the group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the contain . in their procedur thei also should have
771	1	2	2	if you were go to replic the experi you would also need to know p what the sampl ar so you could us them p how much vinegar to put into the contain . p what materi you need to gather without the abov inform you couldn t properli replic the experi .
772	1	0	0	the procedur could be better if thei includ in there experi a control if thei label each sampl specif with what process thei ar us whether it be marbl limeston wood or plastic . last the procedur doesn t includ a clear purpos why ar thei do thi experi is it hess cari what varieti do thei receiv from thi .
773	1	2	2	to replic that experi you would need to know what the name ar of what your weight . the student also need to includ how much vinegar to pour at each of the sampl be test . the final thing would be that the whole procedur need to be more thorough and more organ with no miss step or inform .
774	1	0	0	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is after you did the experi find out the mass again do everyth you did alreadi but start with the inform you alreadi have then determin the mass you end up with and the differ in the mass . that s how i would replic the experi .
775	1	0	0	to replic the experi you would need to includ a coupl step to the procedur in order to make it clear and valid . thei should add a control to it to improv it with their result and to make it more clear includ . lastli that you need to find the differ between the start and end mass .
776	1	0	0	addit inform that should ve been ad to the acid rain experi is that there need to be more sampl becaus someth could ve went wrong dure at least on of the trial . bin thei didnt just try a plain trial with other thing to see if it effect the end mass .
777	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi the group s procedur should mention which sampl to us . marbl limeston wood and plastic . it should also contain more detail inform such as the amount vinegar pour in each contain and the size of the sampl need for test .
778	1	1	1	after you would rins each sampl it would be best to check the report how much vinegar where us and i would like to know special how mani acid you us in thi experi .

853	1	0	0	the first start mass wa for wood . g end mass . g and differ in mass . g . second wa limeston with start mass . g end mass . g differ . g . third start mass wa marbl . g end mass at . g and differ in mass . g . last wa plastic start mass . g end mass . g differ . g .
854	1	0	0	the group would need to tabl the date explain what thei ar try to experi and also write a good conclus on what the outcom of their experi wa . thi will help the pa natur to make and sinc as to what you ar try to find out and dai .
855	1	2	2	some addit inform how much vinegar do i pour into the cup . who sampl materi ar thei us . how do i find the mass of each sampl that is the addit inform that need to be ad .
856	1	0	0	i would need the procedur the sampl start mass end mass and differ in mass .
857	1	2	2	addit inform i would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the student put into each contain . i would also need to find out what type of vinegar wa in us for thi experi .
858	1	1	1	after read the group s procedur some addit inform i would need to replic the experi would be p to know the amount of vinegar thei us p to know what their control variabl is and their independ variabl ar sinc thei didn t label that p to know whether or not the mass of the materi wa with the mass of the contain becaus that will effect the result and decreas valid .
859	1	2	3	some addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar wa pour into the separ contain what kinda of contain or size of contain . wa each sampl pour in to . and final why did the group of student and with distil water . why couldn t thei just leav it how it wa .
860	1	3	3	on piec of inform i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the contain . a second piec is to know sampl of what the first step sai sampl but can thei be anyth lastli i need to know if it matter where i leav my experi . i should know if it need to be in hot or cold temperatur or if it need sunlight and factor like that .
861	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur i think that thei should sai in their chart how much vinegar thei put in the ident contain . also thei should put in the chart the time differ or did thei do it at the same time and what kind of contain did thei us beaker test tube a regular contain
862	1	3	3	to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to us in the sampl two how big the piec of rock ar if thei ar the same or not and think you would need to know more about the contain do thei need a lid to cover evapor how larg ar thei . more specif inform is need to replic thi experi from the procedur student here .
863	1	0	0	. place marbl limeston wood and plastic into separ contain . p . let them sit for hour and remov them after and rins them with distil water . p . allow the sampl to dry for minut .
864	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each contain also how long it rins after the hour and a problem statement said also be necessari .
865	1	2	2	in thi experi the group need to add some extra inform so other student can replic thi procedur . when it tell us to pour the vinegar in each of the contain it doesn t tell me how much i should fill in them . step is unclear when it state to place a sampl of on materi into on contain it doesn t explain the sampl . also thei need to tell whether thei ar measur the sampl .
866	1	2	2	first you would need to know the much vinegar to us in order to keep the experi consist . next you would need to know the size of the marbl becaus differ size might each erato faster . also you would need to know the kind of wood becaus some wood might solv faster than other kind .
867	1	1	1	when simul acid rain in thi experi it would be import to includ consist measur to the data and result ar accur . thei should start with the same amount of mass a each sampl . so the chang is seen easier and each sampl is affect equal . by the same wage it is also import that the sampl be submerg in the same amount of vinegar . b c the lab goal is to nonc chang base on acid rain it import the experi be as close and as repeat as possibl .
868	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi there is some inform that is need . the size of the contain need to be determin . also the procedur just sai four differ sampl it never sai what there need to be a number for how much vinegar need to be pour into the contain . final it doesn t sai how long the sampl should be rins for . if those thing ar includ in the procedur then the experi could be duplic .
869	1	1	1	there is on piec of inform on that you would need in order to replic thi experi that thei forgot . you need to know the amount of vinegar that need to go into each cup . if you didnt know that the whole experi wouldnt be correct . you should have the vinegar at a constant measur .
870	1	2	2	first you need to specifi how much vinegar is us per contain . second you need a control for comparison purpos . third you need to state the size of the contain .
871	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to why thei ar perform thi experi and what it is try to prove . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain to keep that a constant . lastli it would be import to know the amount of each sampl to add to the vinegar so that the sampl aren t differ becaus that could vari your result .
872	1	1	0	the addit inform that i would need to know how mani of each individu sampl i am find the mass for p thei didn t sai how much marbl or limeston or wood or plastic thei just said a sampl .
873	1	2	2	addit inform need to replic the experi would be how mani m s of vinegar would i pour into the four contain . also i would need to know what materi to put in each contain . i would also need to know the measur .
874	1	3	3	in the student procedur you would need to includ the step for measur out an exact amount of vinegar and ad that specif amount to the contain and thei would need to includ the amount of distil water to rins with in order to increas the valid . also thei should specifi what type of contain to put each sampl in such as a test tube or a beaker . the student should specifi what sampl to us in step as well so that when replic the same sampl will be us .
875	1	1	0	in order to replic the experi on would need addit info that the group left out of their procedur . the group need to includ the problem a hypothesi of what thei re test materi thei need to perform the experi and a conclus that analys their data and state whether their hypothesi wa wrong or right . the group also need to list the amount of each sampl us so that can remain a constant not a variabl chang .
876	1	1	1	how much vinegar you will need to put in the contain what is the control variabl what s the depend and independ variabl .
877	1	0	0	what you would also need to know is why you would leav it in the contain for hour and not ani other time . how you got the mass for the four differ sampl and why you would let it sit out for min .
878	1	0	0	in the experi thei wood is the on that shape the same and the limeston the on that went down the most . if the experi wa for an hour it would doubl .
879	1	1	1	how much of each sampl should i us to replic the experi . p how much vinegar should i us when replic the experi . p what should i us to determin the mass in my experi .
880	1	1	1	to successfulli replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain becaus the result might come out differ with differ measur of materi . i would also need to know the amount of each sampl to place in the vinegar . the final piec of inform i would need to know is how much distil water i am allow to us to wash the vinegar off of the sampl .
881	1	0	0	to make a hypothesi . p after to make a conclus . p determin if the investig is good or bad .
882	1	1	1	to replic thi experi i need to know the exact volum of the vinegar at the begin and the volum at the end of the experi .
883	1	2	2	i would need to know what the four differ sampl of materi i wa mass were . i would need to know how much vinegar to add . i would need to be told to calcul the differ in mass onc the end mass wa found . in the begin the procedur should also sai to gather all materi and safeti equip goggl hat
884	1	2	2	thei need to tell how much vinegar thei need in each contain . thei need to tell like where thei will place the contain if it ha to be in warm place or room temperatur . thei have actual determin the mass .
885	1	2	2	to be abl to do the same experi exactli the wai the group of student did i would need the amount of vinegar in each asp . i would also need to know the environ around the sampl for exampl the temperatur thei were left to sit in . lastli i would try to keep the start mass about the same for each materi and give the number in the procedur .
886	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know what kind of sampl materi is need how much vinegar to put in each contain and how much of each sampl is necessari to get the best result .
887	1	2	2	after read the group procedur i would need addit inform in each to replic thi experi . for exampl i would need to know how big should the contain be to put the sampl . then how much vinegar should be ad to each contain . final i would need to know if all the four sampl be put in the contain at the same or will it affect the final result of the experi .
888	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i would need is know what type of sampl i would need to measur the mass . addition i would need to know what kind of contain to put the sampl in . also i would need to know how to measur the mass of the sampl befor and after the experi .
889	1	0	1	you would need to know first the materi need for the experi . then if the materi ar list it will be easier to us them later on in the procedur . second you will need to know how to measur the mass like with a tripl beam balanc . also you will need to know how to remov the sampl from the contain . would it be necessari to take it out it out with your hand or mai be us a tissu or metal handler to remov sampl .
890	1	2	2	what kind of contain big small what ar the sampl thei don t tell us what thei ar thei could be anyth you don t know there rock until you look at the data tabl . in thi thei sai to place a sampl of a materi into a contain and label . what sampl what materi what contain and what ar we suppos to label the sampl or what is be put into
891	1	1	1	in order to keep thi experi valid you would have to make sure when thei ar to over night that thei should all be in the same exact condit .
892	1	3	3	to replic thi experi you would need the follow inform . you would need the amount of vinegar the student us you would need the type of sampl thei us and would also need the type of contain that were us . also you would need the start mass of each of the sampl that the student us .
893	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to us the size of the contain the ph of the vinegar and the room temperatur
894	1	3	3	a the group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sampl . p b the size of each sampl should also be state becaus size differ would affect the result of thi experi . p c would need to know what materi to gather .
895	1	2	2	i would need to know what ar the sampl like the on thei put in their tabl at other on . thei don t state what the sampl have to be . thei also don t sai how much should the sampl weigh . thei also don t sai how much vinegar should be us . should it be the same amount or no becaus thei all weigh differ amount .
896	1	2	2	after read the group procedur i would need to know the most import part of the experi the sampl i would us . in the procedur the group doe not sai that you need marbl limeston wood and plastic . addit inform i would need would be how much of each sampl i would need becaus i mai need a band or coupl of anc and i would need to know how much vinegar to us for each sampl .
897	1	0	0	thi tabl is not so clear it onli ha the depend variabl . it s still miss the control group . the indec variabl is the chang in mass . the purpos of thi experi wa to see the differ mass for four differ sampl .
898	1	2	2	the three addit inform you would need for a complet procedur for acid rain would be tell what each sampl wa in order to do the project . and also how much vinegar to put insid each separ contain and last wa what temperatur should you rise the sampl in water after hour process .
899	1	0	0	well first thing thei do wa thei determin the mass of the sampl thei vinegar on differ sampl and than thei wash it with water .
900	1	0	0	the addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi is determin the mass of forc differ sampl make sure you let it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident contain .
901	1	1	2	i would need to know how much vinegar wa us . i would also need to know what condit the contain wa left in when it wa left for hour . lastli i would need to know more specif about the sampl materi such as what type of wood or plastic wa us .
902	1	1	1	addit inform that the group would need in their procedur is a hypothesi to get them start . a final statement at the end of the experi to clarifi whether or not their procedur wa accur . on import thing thei need to mention in thi procedur is what four differ materi we ar us .
903	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the group need to clarifi a certain mass for all of the sampl . otherwis the data can be affect without thi constant . also it is import to includ what sampl ar from sinc the data tabl clarifi that marbl limeston wood and plastic ar the specif materi us . thi need to be includ in the procedur . final the group need to includ a specif amount of vinegar pair into each cup so that variat in the amount of vinegar don t affect the valid of the experi .
904	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi on would need to know first or all what each sampl is . thei would also need to know how much vinegar to us on the materi . lastli thei would need to know how mani sampl of each materi . the would need and the substanc size .
905	1	2	2	addit inform that i would need in order to replic thi experi would be what the sampl ar how much vinegar i am suppos to pour into the contain and lastli how do i determin the mass of each sampl in other word what type of measur devic do i us .
906	1	1	1	to replic thi experi first off i have to know which sampl is which . when record the mass i will not know which belong to the correct sampl . also it doe not tell us in what metric unit we ar measur the sampl with so thi need to be clearer . last of all in order to replic thi experi i need to know how much vinegar need to be ad into the contain becaus differ amount of vinegar can chang the result . last of all in step it tell us to remov the sampl but i do not know wai to remov those sampl in a separ cup or contain
907	1	3	3	so addit inform you would add in order to replic the experi would be what kind of contain
908	1	0	0	you would need the start mass end mass and differ in mass .
909	1	2	1	you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . you would also need to know how much of the sampl materi you should put in the contain . in addit you need to know how you would remov the sampl from the contain weather you can touch them or have to grab them with someth els .
910	1	1	1	addit inform need in order to replic in experi would be how much vinegar would be pour in the contain . if you do too much it s or not put the same amount in each mass the experi will be dri . also name the contain with each sampl so you know what when you write down your data . includ record data would or addit inform too becaus if it wasn t without a procedur someon might forget to write all the data down .
911	1	0	0	what is the independ variabl and what the depend variabl also don t p forget about the control .
912	1	0	0	in order for or to replic the experi the chart need to show everi piec of the experi like what happen when you put vinegar on four separ pile but ident contain on how you put on piec of of materi in on contain and label them the do the with the remain sampl on piec of materi in on contain for all of it each . by show all the data then you ll be abl to replic the experi .
913	1	2	2	on thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step to pour into the contain . anoth piec of inform that would be help for thi procedur is how much of each sampl you need to put into the contain in step . a last thing you need to know is how long do you rins the sampl off for in step .
914	1	1	1	. you need to know the amount of vinegar be ad . p . you need a control group . p . you need to know what your label each contain .
915	1	1	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how to find the mass of the sampl possibl us an electron balanc . i would also need to know how big of a contain to us . sometim if you have a lot of vinegar the result will be differ . i would also need to know the purpos of the lab . is it to see the effect vinegar ha on each of the sampl
916	1	0	0	i would need to determin the mass of four differ sampl . also place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label and after hour remov the sampl from the contain . i would have to do the mass of gram for the sampl .
917	1	0	0	make sure to includ at least three piec of inform . sampl have lost in for nation becaus get inform . sampl allow the sampl to fit and dry for minut . p becaus determin the mass of each sampl .
918	1	1	1	first would want to know what materi i would be test in the procedur the student do not provid a clear explan of what is be test . also how do we move the sampl without touch them with our finger thei should specifi if we need to us forc to move them or not . the acid on our finger could affect the sampl thei should also describ how to figur out the mass the wai thei wrote the procedur make it so that on would not know what devic to us to figur their new mass .
919	1	1	1	to replic the experi you would need to know what kind of sampl you could us such as marbl or plastic . you would also need to know how to determin the sampl and to find the differ in mass at the end . between the start mass and the end mass of each sampl .
920	1	2	2	the addit inform you would have to indic thi procedur and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain how big the contain ar and how you determin the mass of each sampl .
921	1	0	0	i think that thei need to u the time on the box us all the other sampl and show how long it stand there threw ar where experi .
922	1	3	3	some addit inform that would need in order to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar you need the size of the contain us in the experi . you would also need to know the temperatur of which the experi would be stai at in the hour period .
923	1	2	2	some addit inform i would need to replic thi experi is how big the contain where also how much vinegar i would need to put in each contain . the last thing i would need to know is if i can us more than four sampl .
924	1	2	3	to replic the group procedur you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain . you would also need a control which would be all the sampl in water and you would need to know where to keep the sampl and what environ thei should be left in .
925	1	1	1	in thi experi you would need to know the purpos of thi experi in order to replic it . the student chart show the befor and after result and the procedur is good howev it doe not state what the purpos is here . i think the purpos is to test permeabl at the sampl . you would also need to know what sampl you could us .
926	1	3	3	after read the group procedur i have vinegar multipl piec of inform in order to replic it p experi would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as thei would rock for the temperatur of the water and what amount the condit thei were around to dry in the .
927	1	3	3	in order to replic the acid rain experi we must know more than what the group ha given us . for exampl in step the student don t tell us how much vinegar need to be pour in each contain . thei also don t tell us what kind of contain and if it matter what it is made out of . in step the group tell us to determin new mass of the sampl . thei don t sai what we us or how to find the mass of the sampl . anoth problem is that thei don t tell us what the sampl ar until we see the data tabl thei should sai it in the procedur .
928	1	3	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar thei us . also you would need to know what size and shape the sampl ar . also you would need to know how to dry the sampl which it doesn t state .
929	1	1	1	thi procedur is not veri specif in it descript . for on it doe not tell you how to find the mass of the four differ sampl . it doe not indic the amount of vinegar to put in the contain or how much of the sampl . it also doe not indic to find the differ in the new mass at the end which is the result that you ar realli look for .
930	1	1	1	after end thi group procedur i have decid that the group need to show how much vinegar is ad to each contain . thei should also includ a purpos and problem statement to clear up we we ar go to replic their procedur .
931	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar thei pour on the three sampl the size of the sampl and the size of the contain . we would have to know all those thing if we want to do thi lab exactli like thei did .
932	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the contain . i would also need to know how much of each sampl i would need to get befor test lastli i would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be abl to draw conclus about my result .
933	1	2	2	the group wa not veri specif in their procedur . in step thei sai determin mass of four differ sampl . sampl of what thei never sai . thei also sai to let it sit for hour where should it sit in the light or dark if i were to follow the procedur the group wrote i would probabl not be abl to control the variabl in the same wai that thei did without guess .
934	1	0	0	some addit inform that would be need with thi experi is a hypothesi . thi is becaus you should predict and guess the thing you could be work with . you would also need a scale to tell you how much each sampl rang in gram .
935	1	3	3	we would need to know how much vinegar to us in each contain also what type of contain should be us and if we re us pure vinegar or if it a solut . lastli it would be help to throw if the contain were left and at room temperatur over the hour .
936	1	3	3	i would trust to know where is be test anoth word the speci materi which we ar take sampl of in addit i would need to know the type of vinegar be sinc differ vinegar have differ ph along with the amount of vinegar ad to each contain these three piec of inform ar all reason to replic the experi .
937	1	1	1	some addit inform that we will need in order to replic the experi is the materi that ar need . the other two thing that is need is that the student should write how to us the materi and also how to clean up and clear everyth out after experi is over .
938	1	2	2	to replic thi experi you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar us in each contain or els the result would be differ . also you would need to know the temperatur of both the vinegar and the water you us you rins the sampl in and the outer temperatur where you let them sit for hour .
939	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi there would have to be instruct on how to find the mass of ann object . the word sampl should be more specif so it s absolut clear what should be place in the contain . lastli there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each contain .
940	1	3	3	after read the group procedur i would need to know some addit inform to replic the experi . first i would need to know what type of materi is be us . anoth thing i would need to know is where to keep the materi in sunlight in dark outsid i would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup .
941	1	1	1	ar other inform you might need to redo thi lab is after what time did thei measur the sampl again now much vinegar thei us and what progress the sampl made in between .
942	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi you will need to know why ar the student make thi experi why ar thei try to get the mass of the element list in the tabl
943	1	1	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa put into each cup . you should also us the same mass as in the origin experi . and you would have to know how much water to us or might have to allow more time for it to dry .
944	1	1	1	after read the group s procedur the addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi is the amount of time to do the experi how long to let the sampl sit each cycl and i would need to know the amount of sampl and vinegar that ha to be in each contain . also i need to know the what the control in thi experi and thei need to describ the independ and depend variabl more fluent so that wai you can know what your deal with .
945	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi is to have more sampl time and contain . so you can us differ sampl differ result of the mass in all object .
946	1	2	2	in the procedur it should includ the four sampl be mass without thi knowledg the experi would be hard to repeat thei should also tell of the method thei ar us to mass the four sampl yet anoth thing that should be ad to thi procedur is what type of contain to us in the experi . these chang to the procedur will make the experi easi for replic .
947	1	3	3	sinc the group procedur is a littl vogu in order to replic the experi you would need to know some addit inform . first you d need to where to let the sampl sit and dry becaus that could make a differ . and you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain sinc that mass to be held constant . final you d need to know what ar the differ sampl to us . you know by look in the data tabl when thei don t list item in the procedur .
948	1	2	2	after read the group procedur addit inform that would be need to replic the experi would be the number of trial that thi experi ha to be done in order for u to be in a more valid . their would also need to put for how long the sampl need to be rins becaus if on sampl wa rins longer than anoth it would affect the differ in mass at the end of the experi . and most importantli thei should be more specif in exactli what the object ar be soak in thi experi for hour or thi experi would be convinc to follow .
949	1	3	2	in order to replic the group procedur i would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into the contain how larg the contain were and how thoroughli the contain should be rins . with these piec of inform i could more accur follow the procedur and hopefulli get similar result .
950	1	0	0	in the inform thei talk about all the procedur that the student did on there experi . the student list everyth but thei didn t give us the time thei start . so you will know when to start the hour . so you can drain them and let them come out .
951	1	1	1	i think that if thi group that did the acid rain . investig should of record the temp . of the vinegar and clear it if it wa the right amount so thei didn t tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happen that happen after thei let the sampl sit and dry .
952	1	0	0	four differ sampl p pour vinegar in each p place a sampl of on materi p after hour allow sampl to sit out for min p determin the mass of each sampl .
953	1	0	0	you would need what the outcom is after the hour . label what liquid you us for thi lab .
954	1	2	2	you would need to know what sampl you would need to us . how much vinegar to put in the contain sai if there wa ani repeat the trial .
955	1	2	2	after read the troop procedur some inform i would add is how much vinegar to put in the cup i would also sai that mayb thei should have mention what the room temp should have been when thei left it over night becaus thi temp could chang the result of the experi and thei realli dont have a depend or independ variabl .
956	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know first what question the student ar try to answer and what the purpos of the lab is . then i would need to know what the three sampl ar . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain and how larg a sampl of each materi to us . the amount ar not specifi . final it would be help to know if a control should be us and what it should be .
957	1	2	2	in order to replic the acid rain experi you would need to know specif what four sampl ar be test how much vinegar should be pour into each contain and what kind of balanc scale should be us to determin the mass
958	1	2	1	it is necessari to have a constant for each of the four differ sampl . the consent would be us water instead of vinegar in the contain with the the sampl . also the student did not state how much vinegar thei put into each contain .
959	1	3	3	after read the group procedur there ar some thing that mai need to be ad to be abl to replic the experi . in the procedur the student would have to add what the four sampl ar that ar be us to determin the mass . also the student us to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four contain . last but not the least the student will have to add what size should all four contain be for the sampl .
960	1	0	0	to replic the experi you will need determin the mass of four differ sampl . allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut place a sampl of on materi into on contain a label repeat with remain sampl place a singl sampl into a singl contain .
961	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi ar to know what the four sampl ar how much vinegar to pour in to the contain why to rins the sampl out with distil water what let the sampl sit and dry for minut doe and what i will measur the sampl in to find their mass
962	1	1	1	the student in the group should have the start mass be the same for the sampl in order to give accur result . also to replic it . i would have to know how much vinegar is be pour into each contain . last the amount of distil water for each sampl should be specifi .
963	1	3	3	the inform that the procedur is miss to be abl to replic the experi is the size of the contain . the size of each sampl and how much vinegar did thei us . without these miss inform then you can not replic the experi .
964	1	2	2	some addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi ar the amount of vinegar put in each contain . you need to know what the four differ sampl ar and you need to know what unit to us when measur the mass of the sampl .
965	1	3	3	i would need a list of materi and know what type of equip to do thi experi on . i would also need to know the problem to thi experi . i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the contain and what size piec is us to do thi experi .
966	1	1	1	in my opinion thei should add more inform of the temperatur becaus differ sampl might react differ in lower or higher temperatur . thei should do more than just on try with each sampl it should be at least to get a better data thei should have measur mass much more often as well .
967	1	3	3	in order to replic thi i would need to know what the sampl thi ar test for so you don t know what to test . also around how much of the sampl do you need g or g or g . also how much vinegar to pour into each contain . thei must should be specif . thei could have also ad what to measur in gram kg lo etc . thei should have also told what type of area to keep the sampl in light dark warm cold .
968	1	2	2	there ar sever piec of addit inform need to replic thi experi . first we need to know how much vinegar to add in order to keep the amount constant and get result like those given . what size and configur should the contain be it sai ident but doe not specifi anyth els . thirdli how do we determin the mass of the sampl
969	1	0	0	at least three piec of inform i would need to replic thi experi is what safeti equip should i wear the exact wai to extract the sampl from their contain what do i need to determin the mass of each sampl
970	1	3	2	first at step on thei need to tell you how to determin the mass of four differ sampl and should also label the sampl there . in step you need to be told how much vinegar to pour . in step it could be help if you were told where to let the sampl dry . then in step onc again you need to be told how you should measur the mass of the sampl .
971	1	3	3	you would need to know the size of the sampl and how much vinegar to us . the size of the contain would also be vital to replic the experi .
972	1	2	2	the addit inform need to replic thi experi includ the start shape and size of the sampl how much vinegar is be pour into the contain and last what is be us to determin the mass of the sampl .
973	1	3	3	in order for me to replic thi experi you would need to know some addit inform . on piec of inform you need to know is how much vinegar is pour in each contain . you also need to know what the condit ar made out of . the last piec of inform you need to know in order to do thi experi is if there is a top on the contain .
974	1	0	0	i dont think i would add ani addit inform the procedur seem pretti straight forward and veri inform .
975	1	3	3	to replic the experi i would have to know the size of it contain i us . also i would need to know how much vinegar thei pour in . lastli what is the sampl materi that a major part of the experi .
976	1	1	0	in order to be abl to recreat thi experi i would need to know what is in the cup . i am assum that it wa same type of acid becaus the marbl lost g the limeston lost . g and the plastic lost g . the acid in the cup would have eaten awai at the materi and differ acid have differ rate of corros so i would need to know what acid acid and it ph in order to recreat thi experi
977	1	3	3	to replic the experi a person would need to know how much vinegar is ad to each sampl . thei would also need to know what contain thei us . a person would also need to know if the contain were cover or not dure the experi .
978	1	0	2	thi experi would need a lot more inform for it to be repeat . it will need a control group so thei can compar it to the rest of the variabl . understand that there need to be a consist amount of vinegar and start materi would help the outcom of the experi . it is also import that the materi ar the same shape and size so thei have the same surfac to volum ratio .
979	1	2	2	without the tabl a lot wouldn t be known by look just at the procedur . first in order to replic the experi you would need to know what four sampl you would be take the mass of . second you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the contain . lastli in order to replic the experi the person would need to know how much distil water should be us to rins the materi . it would also help if it wa specifi in the procedur with what should the person be find the mass of the materi balanc . in what unit gram .
980	1	1	1	the procedur did not tell the reader that thei would have to record their data . thi is import to replic the experi becaus if you do the experi without write anyth down you can t see the result as well . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain and have it be the same amount for each sampl . you might also want to includ the differ between the start end mass in the data find .
981	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar that get pour into contain what type of contain have vinegar is in and now much distil water to rins each materi rile without much detail the experi that i would conduct would mass like give me differ result that the group of student .
982	1	3	3	the addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi would be what size do the contain have to be how much vinegar to pour in the contain how big do the sampl have to be what should the label sai on them how much water do i us and how long do i rins for and how do i measur the mass
983	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the group of student need a control . in warm water is us as the substitut for vinegar . in the first step the student need to identifi the fast differ sampl that ar go to us experi on . also the procedur did not identifi how much vinegar should be need to pass on the sampl . thi addit inform would make the experi more valid as it will be will be easier to follow .
984	1	3	3	the group of student didn t specifi what sampl thei were refer to . secondli thei didn t includ how much vinegar to add to the contain in step nor did thei list the size and or volum of said contain . thei didn t give instruct on how or what to label the contain in step or how much distil water on would need to rins the sampl with in step . all of these would need to be taken into consider in order to replic the experi .
985	1	0	0	. determin the mass of four differ sampl . p . instead of pour vinegar pour a differ kind of liquid . p . us three differ kind of contain to see what happen . p . after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . p . allow the sampl to sit and dry for min . p . determin the mass of each sampl .
986	1	1	1	to replic thi experi you would need the four differ sampl us materi us in thi experi and a start time and end time .
987	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . the group now specifi how much vinegar wa us in their experi .
988	1	2	2	if i wa to replic the experi i would need to know how to get the mass of each sampl materi . i would also need to know how much vinegar you need and i need to know the size of the cup thei ar us .
989	1	1	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar you ar us to put in the four cup what measur tool you ar us to measur the mass of the sampl and what your determin the mass of . in their procedur it doesn t sai how much vinegar thei us nor the measur tool thei us . it also doesn t provid us with the answer of what thei ar actual get the mass of .
990	1	2	2	after read the group procedur a few thing ar miss . i would need to know the exact mass each sampl should be befor the experi . by have all the mass s the same it would be easier to determin the differ . i would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of sampl would get . also some inform such as how long i should rins the sampl for after the hour would be help in the replica of thi experi .
991	1	0	0	if you want tor replic the order then you would have to doubl everyth in the ma trial that were provid for you .
992	1	2	2	how much vinegar to us . the temperatur the experi wa conduct under . how much of such sampl should be us .
993	1	1	1	sai the amount of vinegar put into each cup how do you determin the mass and
994	1	1	1	how much vinegar do you pour in the four contain .
995	1	3	3	in thi procedur the group should also add inform of the exact amount of vinegar us the measur of how much of the sampl were put into each contain the temperatur control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of contain thei us . all thi inform is need to replic the experi .
996	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain and whether it s the same amount for each . in order for the experi to be replic the student need to do or more trial for each to gain repli billi . you also need have a control which would be on of each place in distil water . the mass of each materi should rel close so that there isn t a drastic chang in mass ar to bigger place or materi .
997	1	3	1	how much basi wa us in each contain rins with distil water for how long . how much the contain have to be .
998	1	2	2	on piec of addit inform would be to give a specif amount of vinegar you would pour in rain contain . anoth would be to give the weight of each of the sampl and make sure thei ar all the same . on more addit piec of inform you could us is the size of the contain .
999	1	2	2	thei need to specifi what the four differ sampl ar becaus it is the independ variabl . thei also neat to includ how much vinegar is us becaus it is a control variabl . know the amount make the experi more accur and more valid . anoth thing is thei don t mention a step in the procedur tell the person to measur the stone befor thei ar place on vinegar . thi is need for comparison . a control on with just pure water is need to increas valid .
1000	1	0	1	addit inform you would need for thi experi is how much water wa in each cup you should also know if all the materi ar close in size .
1001	1	1	1	in these procedur it s not explain what thi sampl is that there put in . so if we knew exactli what is wa it would help . there should be a control with contain without vinegar to compar to the other sampl with vinegar . the last thing to make the procedur right is to know the mass of each sampl to know much to us .
1002	1	2	2	after read thi procedur the student could add the amount of vinegar in number that you would pour into the differ contain . anoth thing the student forgot wa the differ sampl what ar thei thei need to includ marbl limeston wood and plastic into the first step . the last thing thei need to add is to includ a step for find the differ in the mass at the end .
1003	1	3	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each contain i would need to know what it is thei label on the contain and i would also need to know the size of each contain .
1004	1	2	2	on would need to know mari thing in order to replic the group s procedur . we would need to know how much vinegar wa pour in each contain how much sampl to put in the contain and how big the contain ar themselv .
1005	1	3	2	first the student should have the amount of vinegar that goe into each contain . also the group should us a control in thi experi . to replic thi experi we will also need to know under what condit the sampl an the vinegar will be in . we would need to know whether or not it wa in the sun or dark becaus that will make a differ .
1006	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into thei contain the group should also state were to let the sampl stir and dry and how big of a contain that the under should of seen and into .
1007	1	3	3	we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . it would also be help to know the size of the contain size of the sampl to us . the process of how to clean the sampl specif as to not effect the mass is lack inform .
1008	1	1	1	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi would be how much of each sampl would you need and how much vinegar how you need in order to perform the experi . also it would be help to know how you measur the mass of each sampl like as what tool you mai need .
1009	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much mass of each sampl i would need . i would also need to know what i should us in order to calcul the mass . anoth thing i would need to know is what materi i am mass thei dont tell you ani of that in the procedur . i also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sampl becaus it seem here the vinegar is suppos to be the control of the experi but if the same amount isn t us each time then it won t be a control .
1010	1	2	2	in order to replic the group experi i m go to need to know how much vinegar i need and how larg of contain i need .
1011	1	2	2	addit inform that i would need to know in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar thei soak the sampl in and how big the contain were that thei us . and i would also need to know what shape the sampl ar .
1012	1	1	1	the student can includ the measur of the vinegar that is pour into the cup . how much of the materi thei will to put into the contain . us the same amount of mass for each object .
1013	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need to replic thi experi is that new and how much vinegar in the contain then also need to specifi what materi to put in the vinegar and how to determin the mass of each materi .
1014	1	2	2	for thi experi to be replic there would need to be a few ad thing such as what should be us us to measur the differ materi . also what would those materi be . it never state what materi to us . how much vinegar should be pour into cup p should it cover the materi or not all the wai the peopl perform have no idea about these thing . there also need to be a control mayb on untouch or put into water .
1015	1	2	2	after read the procedur addit inform that you would need to replic the experi would be to know how much vinegar thei pour in the four contain . explain how to determin the mass of each sampl and state what kind of vinegar wa us .
1016	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar i am put into the four contain .
1017	1	0	2	. on thing that could be ad to the pro clever is that you could try us anoth liquid rather than vinegar . . anoth thing that you could chang is add two of each type so there would be stone type plastic and wood . . instead of rins each sampl after hour you could measur the mass with the vinegar and then rins it off and measur without the vinegar .
1018	1	0	0	the addit inform you need in order to replic the experi would be the time the exampl wa start the differ in mass from all four sampl and determin which sampl had more mass which sampl had the least . an explan of why the amount of mass wa that amount
1019	1	0	0	repeat step p round thi data for the nd trial p compar the trial and find the averag mass for the four sampl . p observ the data and make a conclus on the experi .
1020	1	0	0	addit inform need in order to replic the experi would be in the procedur write you need to make a data tabl to record inform form a hypothesi and you would need a control .
1021	1	2	2	. what ar the four differ sampl p . how much vinegar ar you suppos to pour into each sampl p . how ar you go to measur the mass
1022	1	2	1	to replic the experi you need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain there need to be a control and you also need to know the shape of the object becaus shape could have an effect on how much materi get dissolv .
1023	1	1	1	thei have to do the hypothesi to test if that mass is good to the experi . p thei have to measur the amount of vinegar . p thei have to know how much time thei have to repeat with remain sampl .
1024	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi there is some inform that wasn t involv that is need . first in the product it just said pour vinegar . it didn t sai how much which is import . anoth import factor that would be need is in what temperatur to let the sampl sit and deep in in step it just said let it dry for minut to didn not sadat what temperatur . final when step sai mix with distil water it doesn t sai what temperatur the distil water ha it just sai distil water . i would need to know at what temperatur distil water ha to be .
1025	1	3	3	i would first need to know what materi the sampl know and i would need to know how much vinegar . i would also need to know how big each sampl should be . also how big the contain would be .
1026	1	1	1	the inform that i would need to replic thi experi is the same type of sampl thei us . the other thing i would need so that the experi could be valid is the time thei start with which is the start mass . last but not repeat all the step thei did in order to have o valid experi .
1027	1	3	3	you need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separ contain . you also need to know what size contain you ar put the sampl in . also you need to know what temperatur you leav the sampl to sit and dry at for min .
1028	1	0	0	on piec of inform i would want to know is how big each piec of rock plastic wood .
1029	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need a control such as water to compar the result to you will need to know how much vinegar to includ in the cup . you also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the sampl . that is the addit inform you need .
1030	1	3	3	. what kind of sampl p . how much vinegar p . what kind of contain
1031	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know how much of each sampl to us it is import to onli vari the type of sampl rather than vari the initi mass too . i would also need to be abl to know how much vinegar to pour onto each sampl . too much or too littl vinegar will chang the mass differ drastic . store the sampl is anoth vital area in thi experi . the temperatur and amount of light the sampl ar expos to need to be directli mention within thi experi .
1032	1	1	1	the peopl do the lab need to stai in the procedur what materi to us first . also thei need to describ how to do all of these step better so thei make more sens . also thei need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing more time with the other materi instead of put that in the middl of the procedur .
1033	1	0	0	first you need vinegar . you must put some in four contain then place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label . then after hour rins each sampl with water . after that let them dry and determin the mass of each sampl .
1034	1	0	0	in order for me to replic thi experi i would have to know how i would determin the mass of each sampl . when do you pour the vinegar in the contain . and what doe distil water mean .
1035	1	0	0	in order for me to replic thi experi i would need a mass scale vinegar contain sticker for label . a watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rins it . i would also need sampl of marbl limeston wood and plastic .
1036	1	1	1	the inform you need in order to replic thi experi is how much of each sampl you ar put into the contain . mayb you should also state what the contain you ar us look like .
1037	1	3	3	to replic the experi you would need sever more piec of inform . firstli the amount of vinegar ad would need to be includ to try and control addit for everi materi . secondli you would need to know where the contain would be left for hour after pour vinegar . differ environ could affect the date . third you would need to know what type of contain to us for the whole experi . differ in volum in differ contain would also affect the data .
1038	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi on piec of inform i would need to know is what materi ar need for the experi . i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . the student should be more specif in give the direct well . thei never tell you how to find the mass of the sampl or the temperatur the vinegar should be becam saw is in . thei should make sure the direct ar more clear and simpl direct like gather materi and clean the area at the begin end .
1039	1	0	0	write down the result that you come up with record your data weigh the sampl so you could determin what the mass is . these ar the three thing that i would includ becaus in their procedur thei never said to weigh the sampl so peopl read thi would think that thei would have to guess when it should be weigh . you would also need the total of all the sampl .
1040	1	1	1	how much vinegar should thei put on each contain .
1041	1	3	3	addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is in the procedur it need to be more specif and staff what kind of sampl you ar us marbl limeston wood plastic also it need to sai how much vinegar to pour into each cup and what kind of cup to us . also how long you should rins each of the sampl with the distil water and lastli be more specif on how to dry the sampl should you dry it with paper towel and then let it sit for minut or just let it sit
1042	1	2	2	the group procedur wa miss the amount of vinegar to put into each of the contain how big each sampl should be and what to weigh each sampl on .
1043	1	3	3	the addit inform need would be the exact amount of vinegar that is pour into each cup . you would also need to know a specif type of contain to put the sampl in . lastli you mai need to know that the sampl ar marbl limeston wood and plastic .
1044	1	1	1	the addit inform need is the amount of vinegar put into the contain . thei had onli done the procedur onc to make it valid thei had to do it more time . thei have to get the exact or the same contain to get a fair result . in the procedur it sai pour vinegar in each of separ but ident contain .
1045	1	2	2	after read thi experi there is a lot i d need to know . how much vinegar ar thei ad to each contain thei need a control group in thi experi to round st result . i would also need to know what sampl goe in each contain .
1046	1	0	0	make sure thei start with the same mass .
1047	1	1	1	after rend the group procedur there ar some thing that i would need or is addit inform would be what type of sampl i us the student tell us to figur out the mass of sampl what kind someth els i could know is the point to the experi in the procedur . it doesn t tell me why to do these . a final piec of inform i can know is what object will be us to measur the mass instead of determin the mass of four differ sampl thei can sai us a to measur .
1048	1	2	2	if you were to replic thi experi you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the contain . you would also have to know what kind of environ you should leav them in and how to determin each mass .
1049	1	3	2	some inform i would need to have dure the procedur would be wither or not to have the same amount of sampl not just their mass . also i would need to know the amount of vinegar need to pour into the contain . and final where do i pour the sampl when filter and after the contain
1050	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi you would need four sampl . the sampl materi should be marbl limeston wood and plastic . also you would need vinegar to pour into the contain which hold the four differ sampl . addition distil water need to be us to rins the materi four differ contain to hold the sampl and a tripl beam balanc to measur the start and end mass of the sampl .
1051	1	1	1	i think that these braid made to for the
1052	1	0	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what the the type of materi where . also how much of each materi would you need in order to be abl to do the experi then it sai you measur the mass of each substanc . you would need to know if thei found the mass in the cup or not . that could affect the out come if you don t know .
1053	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to know how much of each sampl thei put in the contain . you would need to know how big the contain were . and final you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the contain .
1054	1	0	0	thei could have ad all of it up and come up with a averag and thei could have come up with the mass for all of them .
1055	1	3	3	to replic thi experi i would need to know what four differ sampl i am get and how to measur the mass . what contain do i put them in how much vinegar do i put into the contain do just let the contain sit out in room temp for hour do i cover the contain how do you measur the end mass of each sampl
1056	1	3	3	to replic the experi you would need to know what sampl to test how much vinegar to put in the contain and the temperatur in which the sampl ar kept for hour .
1057	1	3	3	in order to replic group s experi we would need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the contain and we would also need equal amount of each sampl . we would also need to know for how long each materi is rins and the volum of the contain .
1058	1	0	0	you would need vinegar in each but separ test that s label them with what thei ar then wait aw s and see the mass chang in the object s you put into the vinegar over night .
1059	1	1	1	if i would replic thi experi i would add to the procedur that you need to weigh the sampl befor ad vinegar to them and determin the mass . i would also add that you need to calcul the differ between the mass . i would also add to the procedur that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sampl .
1060	1	1	1	you would need to know what kind of materi wa us marbl limeston wood and plastic . what would happen if the sampl cud not dry within minut . if you could not let them sit longer or if it wa crush that thei would onli sit for minut . lastli you would need to know how you determin the mass of the sampl . what do you us to measur the sampl and when
1061	1	2	2	first you would need to know the amount of vinegar that ar to be put into each contain . also you would need to know what type if contain to us . next the student should have put how he carri the sampl and how rins it off exactli in order to replic it . anoth thing that should have been includ is the temperatur of the water becaus it is possibl that on temperatur wash of the solut better than anoth .
1062	1	1	1	addit inform need is you would need to know is what the mass from the case contain when thei were full . you need to know the four differ sampl . how mani contain you need .
1063	1	1	1	. you would need an experiment control have just vinegar . p . no more than on trial for each sampl to have precis . p . you would need to label how much vinegar would be put in .
1064	1	0	0	first addit inform would be to measur the start mass of each sampl befor step . then after step find the differ in mass of each sampl . the step befor step should be to collect all the sampl .
1065	1	1	1	i would have to know how much of each sampl i would need to put in the cup . as well as need to know how much distil water in need after the hour also i would need to know where to place the contain after thei need to sit for hour . i would need to know all of thi if i want to replic the experi .
1066	1	1	2	addit inform that would be need top replic the experi is the type of differ sampl . i would also need to tell us how much vinegar to put into cup . if thei do not specifi then the result mai come out complet differ . thei should also determin how to mass the materi and what measur thei would us .
1067	1	3	3	after read the group s procedur i realiz that the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is the name of the four differ sampl you need to know the sampl ar limeston wood marbl plastic or the person do the experi would not know what the sampl ar . you also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each contain and the size of the contain us .
1068	1	3	3	the first most dam piec of inform miss from the procedur is the type of sampl you need in the experi . you cannot replic the experi without know what sampl to us . the next piec of inform miss is how larg the sampl should be . you should not have to guess what or appropri size should be . also the procedur doe not includ the amount of vinegar need to be pour into each contain . the amount of vinegar need is essenti inform . also the procedur doe not includ how or where the sampl should be store . for exampl should thei be left cover or not
1069	1	1	1	you need to add to number it should sai how much distil water for number it should sai how much vinegar .
1070	1	0	0	those piec of inform you need to replic thi experi ar from the sampl in hour . pour vinegar into four separ but ident contain and to allow the sampl be dry you also need to determin the mass of the sampl first .
1071	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi three more piec of inform i would need to figur out ar how much water to rins the sampl with where to place the contain dure the hour under sunlight in shade and also what size the contain is and what shape . on more piec of inform we would need to know is how mani more trial to perform will all that new inform i will be abl to perform a more valid experi .
1072	1	2	2	in the procedur the group should have told wa the differ sampl where also could add a control for thi experi . thei also should have determin and shown how much vinegar wa be ad .
1073	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the student need to specifi what type of sampl ar need to be us to find the mass . the student also need to specifi how much vinegar to pour in the contain . accur result would requir a set amount of vinegar . anoth thing the student need to includ in order for someon to recreat the experi is to includ what to label the contain . step wa too vagu and it would be better to sai label what materi is in the contain . thei also should add more trial for more accur result .
1074	1	0	0	what would need to replic the experi is the mass of four differ sampl vinegar contain and water .
1075	1	2	2	thi group s procedur wa good but some addit thing i would have ad wa the number of sampl i determin the mass of the differ sampl i believ that thei also should have ad the amount of vinegar thei were ad to the ident contain thei also should put how much of the sampl to put into the contain .
1076	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi a list of materi should be includ especi the depend variabl marbl limeston wood plastic . it is not suffici to have the indec incap be list in the data tabl . each substanc marbl limeston wood and plastic should replac the word sampl in step . the procedur should also includ how much distil water rins with becaus wash with differ amount of water can creat hidden variabl becaus some sampl retain water better than other wood retain water better than plastic . there is also no indic when the experi or should stop rins the sampl . in addit the student did not mention that the mass should be determin us an electron balanc measur in gram .
1077	1	0	0	to replic the experi i need four differ exampl then i need to pour vinegar in each but ident contain then i need to place a sampl of on a materi into on contain and label then take it out of the contain after h and dry for minut . final determin the mass of each exampl .
1078	1	0	0	you will need to repeat thi inform an over again to see how your score come out to be and if your not satisfi then you can do it over again to see if it s right .
1079	1	2	2	in the given procedur it would help replic the experi if is includ in it a list of what materi were us thi is import to know as well as how much vinegar should to us to pour into each beaker . if we do not know thi inform then we mai get wildli differ result . final what wa need to determin be mass of the sampl . depend on the need a differ method we possibl a differ mass could be found . also it mai help to have the four sampl start made at the same mass so you don t get skew result
1080	1	3	3	the first thing is that the student need to specifi their sampl in the procedur instead of just be gener sai sampl . thei also need to tell you to find record the start mass of each sampl . you d also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain . final thei need to sai at what temperatur thei should sit room temp .
1081	1	2	2	after read the group procedur there ar some piec of inform that ar not given for exampl the group doe not sai how much vinegar wa pour in the contain . thei don t state how thei find the mass of each sampl . lastli thei don t give the name or amount of each sampl .
1082	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi i would need to know the differ type of sampl . thei should add that to the procedur . anoth import piec of inform i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the contain . also i would need to know what the control is . thei don t have a control to show how the other were affect .
1083	1	3	3	the three inform miss in that lab is the measur of vinegar size of the contain and also the size of each sampl becaus if on of those ar differ it s easili affect the final result .
1084	1	1	1	first i would describ the materi i am us becaus in their procedur thei onli told us their put vinegar in them thei didn t sai what .
1085	1	0	0	what type of marbl limeston wood and plastic did thei us
1086	1	2	2	to replic the experi you need to be told the four sampl the you test . you also need to know how much vinegar you us you mai also need to know how much you
1087	1	0	0	need to replic thi experi
1088	1	2	3	you would need to indic what type of materi ar be us in the experi . you would need to know how much vinegar is be us . you would need to know how long to rins the sampl for as well as the amount of distil water be us to rins them .
1089	1	2	2	i would need to know the size of the contain and how much vinegar i put in contain .
1090	1	0	0	the inform that you will need for the experi is the result of the whole inform follow the depend variabl and independ variabl .
1091	1	2	2	three addit piec of inform that ar need to do thi procedur ar how do you determin the mass how much vinegar do you need in each cup and thei should have written the four differ sampl in the procedur .
1092	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain tell what the differ sampl ar in the direct and to be sure about the answer perform the experi or time again .
1093	1	0	0	need to follow the procedur also need to know them too .
1094	1	1	1	to replic the group procedur i would need to know how to determin the mass of the differ sampl such as what would i us . anoth piec of inform i would need to know is how much vinegar should i poor into the the four ident contain and the last thing i would need to know is what would i us to determin how much the mass is of each sampl after sift in vinegar .
1095	1	0	0	you mai also us a coupl of sampl in case you make a mistak while you ar put that on sampl in that contain . you never know you can me up .
1096	1	3	3	you would need to know if the vinegar wa to cover the whole sampl or not as thi would affect the amount of mass lost . you would need to know how long to rins the sampl in distil water as it could effect your result and differ in mass . you would also might want to consid how big of a piec of sampl to us .
1097	1	1	1	in order for you to replic thi experi you need to know how much of the materi thei put in each cup . how much water you need and the amount of vinegar .
1098	1	2	2	after read the procedur the addit thing i need to know is what size contain how much vinegar to put in the contain .
1099	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you need to know the mass for each sampl if it s the same or not you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the contain . the given procedur doesn t tell the locat so you need to know the locat of the contain .
1100	1	2	2	three thing that should be includ in thi procedur is first it doesn t sai how much vinegar is need . second it doesn t state what ar the sampl like what rock thei ar . it should state specif that there should be lime tone or marbl . a third addit inform is need is how mani trial to do of thi . a fourth addit is what would the mass be measur with . a fifth is that it should be state whether or not there is a control in the experi .
1101	1	2	2	addit inform you would need to repeat thi experi would be what kind of sampl ar be place in the vinegar . also you would need to know how much vinegar is be place into each contain .
1102	1	1	1	in order for myself or anoth to accur replic thi acid rain procedur line two would have to be edit from pour vinegar in each of the four separ but ident contain to pour amount in ml of vinegar in each . thi extra step will help with the valid keep the procedur a lot more accur in order to help someon els or even them self replic the experi accur .
1103	1	3	3	in order to thi experi to be replic i would need to know how mani or what size sampl i should be weigh how much vinegar need to be pour what to label each contain and how long i need to rins each sampl . onli if i know these specif detail will i then be abl to complet the experi like the other group .
1104	1	1	0	on thing thei can improv their procedur by is state what to measur the mass of the rock with . most like thei should us gram or miligram . also thei should have a step for record their data . final the should sai that in step all cup should have the same amount of vinegar . thei should also add a control .
1105	1	0	0	what we need is two determin the mass of the sampl and the label and thei repli need to rins it more .
1106	1	1	1	in thi experi you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the contain . you would also have to have a specif amount that you would us to sampl each materi . thi would allow on compar each sampl effect . in step the procedur sai to remov the sampl . in order to replic the experi on would need more inform on how to remov the sampl from the contain .
1107	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi there ar thing that you would need to know . the first thing is you need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain . the second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sampl to us in thi experi . lastli in order to replic thi experi you would need to know what to us to measur the dri rock .
1108	1	0	0	what you would need noth everyth seem to be alright with the procedur .
1109	1	2	1	addit inform you would need to replic thi experi includ the amount of each sampl us the materi us such as equip to mass each sampl and amount of contain need . also you would need to know the amount of vinegar pour on each sampl .
1110	1	3	3	addit inform that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the contain at the begin of the procedur . also what type of contain should you put the sampl in how big should thei be . anoth thing would have to be how big all of the sampl need to be so the result come out right .
1111	1	2	2	if i wa go to replic thi experi i would need to know what the sampl ar how much vinegar i need to pour in the contain and if i should measur it befor i start .
1112	1	0	0	the inform that i would need to order to replic the experi would be what the purpos of the experi is . thei give me what to do but not what i m look for .
1113	1	2	1	some addit inform thi group would need would be a depend variabl . thei would also need to tell how thei rins the sampl . how much vinegar wa us . how much of the sampl were us . it doesn t sai how much wa us in step or .
1114	1	2	2	the three thing s that i think the procedur could and should have had but didn t wa the type of contain to put the sampl in how much vinegar to pour in and what to determin the mass with . these thing ar import becaus if there ar differ type s of contain it might effect the result if on sampl ha more vinegar than anoth it will not be accur and the mass can be done on mani thing .
1115	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each contain . you also need to be more specif and us proper name of thing instead of us the word sampl . also step should be switch with step . in order to make sens you should label thing befor you pour staff into the contain and thi will help in the replic of the experi .
1116	1	3	3	the procedur for the acid rain lab should includ sever piec of inform that were overlook . first there wa no specif regard the sampl the student did not includ inform as to the gener categori of materi test . let done specifi which suitabl materi were us marbl limeston wood and plastic . thei also fail to determin the temperatur the sampl were stare at as well as the concentr of the vinegar with import measur that can potenti affect data .
1117	1	3	3	i would need to know how much vinegar thei us . how big the materi were that thei us what kind of contain thei were us .
1118	1	0	1	step should be to gather each materi . p you need to know what materi to us . p step should tell you how to do the graph .
1119	1	2	1	on piec of addit inform that i would need to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar that should be pour in each of the four contain . thi is import becaus the vinegar is what caus the sampl to lose mass so the amount of mass lost in each sampl . if the amount of vinegar is inconsist then the data won t be valid . i would also need to know the amount of each sampl need and the mass of the contain .
1120	1	0	0	find the differ in mass .
1121	1	2	2	after read the group procedur the addit inform i would need is the amount of vinegar us how to find the mass and the room temperatur in order to replic the experi .
1122	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi thei would need an equat to work with a tabl of ingredi and the conclus .
1123	1	3	3	to replic thi experi i will need to know the size of the contain in which i should pour the vinegar the amount of vinegar and the size of the materi .
1124	1	0	0	the start mass the end mass the differ in the mass label the sampl .
1125	1	2	2	the inform that i would need to replic thi experi is what materi i am put in the contain . i need to kind the control group independ variabl depend variabl control variabl . also what temperatur thei were in and what i am labor the contain .
1126	1	1	1	thei should have told what thei were us to weight the materi and thei should of said how much vinegar to us .
1127	1	2	2	to replic the experi i would need to know the substanc us as the sampl . i also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup . the start inca for the sampl would need to be ident for all other sampl be us in the experi .
1128	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i need to know how much vinegar i should put into the four separ contain . i would also need to know what temperatur . i should place the contain while thei sit for hour . i would need to know where i should place the contain too for exampl in light in dark place or have it expos to sunlight .
1129	1	2	2	i would need to know how much vinegar i wa pour into everi cup . i would need to know what the sampl were in the procedur . i would also need to know to record the data and take observ .
1130	1	2	2	on piec of addit inform that is need is the amount of vinegar necessari to pour in the contain . also it should explain how to determin the mass of the sampl . in order to replic thi i would need to know what sampl thei place into the contain .
1131	1	1	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know what type of measur item i would need to determin the mass of each sampl . also i need the name of the sampl that i need to us such as marbl or wood . lastli i need from the procedur a control becaus i need to be told what i am test for .
1132	1	3	3	in order to run thi experi i would need to know what sampl ar be test . i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solut . i would also need to know what size the contain should be that i m pour the solut into .
1133	1	3	3	what ar the four differ sampl there is no control so how do you know what water is . how much vinegar do you need to put into the contain how big doe the sampl need to be .
1134	1	2	2	some of the thing i would like to know is what ar the four ident contain what ar the sampl and what ar thei test for exactli .
1135	1	3	3	there ar sever piec of inform that need to be ad in order to replic
1136	1	0	0	the group would need a problem hypothesi and a conclus of what happen in thi experi these thing would make the experi a whole lot better it would readi state what thei ar try to figur out .
1137	1	2	2	i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup . i would need to know how much distil water i would need and how to determin the mass of each sampl . also how big would the cup have to be
1138	1	1	1	the inform that you would need in order to replic the experi ar a control group . also what ar the four differ sampl anoth addit inform would be a graph to chat what happen and a conclus .
1139	1	0	0	you would have to pour vinegar in each four separ but ident contain . let it sit for hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . and then allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut .
1140	1	0	0	i would need to know why wood did not chang why limeston it bigger and why plastic is small number
1141	1	3	3	in order to complet thi experi i would need to have
1142	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to add what sampl you ar us like marbl limeston wood and plastic . you would also need to sai how much vinegar to put into each contain and lastli you need to sai too also determin the differ between each mass .
1143	1	0	0	record mass of all differ sampl record the start mass of each sampl record the entri mass and the differ in mass .
1144	1	0	0	place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label repeat with remain sampl mean a sampl into a singl contain .
1145	1	1	1	thi group of student did not includ mani import inform that wa need in order to replic thi lab experi . on addit inform thei could have ad wa the measur in which thei determin the mass of the four differ materi did thei us a scale of a claus . anoth addit inform wa the amount of vinegar pour into the contain these student did not specifi how much vinegar to pour which can definit chang the outcom of the experi . lastli the student did not creat a control from which thei can compar their result with .
1146	1	3	3	you would need to know how much vinegar wa put in to each sampl find the size and shape of the contain so the same amount of vinegar wa actual cover the sampl . you would need to know the shape or volum of sampl becaus the surfac ar ha to be the same so the same amount is affect by the vinegar .
1147	1	0	0	in order to replic thi experi i would need four of the differ mass sampl and also pour vinegar in each of the four separ but ident contain and place a singl sampl into a singl contain for hour and after that remov it and let it dry for min and determin the mass of each sampl .
1148	1	3	3	the reliabl isn t veri good becaus there ar rather vagu direct on improv would be to measur ad how mani millilit of vinegar would be pour into each contain so the amount of vinegar can be a control variabl like ml per contain . also the procedur need to state the temperatur at which the contain at for hour at so the repel ilyin can have the same temperatur . also there should be a certain amount of time to rins the sampl with distil water such as second each so the sampl have been equal rins .
1149	1	1	1	the experi is and requir everydai materi . if i did thi experi i would includ the temperatur of the vinegar and the measur amount of vinegar in each contain .
1150	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know what the four differ sampl were the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the contain and i would need to know the problem statement . i would need to know these thing becaus differ amount of chemic can caus differ reaction and becaus without them i wouldn t know what i wa test for .
1151	1	1	1	addit inform i would need to know to know is how much vinegar i would need to put into each up . thi inform would make sure that i get the same result everi time . instead of put too much or too littl of the substanc .
1152	1	0	0	some addit inform you need in order to replic the experi is more inform how much time and hold in order to determin the mass of each sampl . also instead of contain us glass bottl .
1153	1	0	1	clearli thi group procedur is not clear . thei ask you to determin the mass of four differ sampl . thei did not state which sampl . thei also did not state what unit of mass to us when weigh the object . without that i cannot be sure if my data will be reliabl .
1154	1	3	3	you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separ contain what type of contain to us and how long to rins the sampl with distil water in order to replic the experi .
1155	1	0	0	to replic thi lab you would need the sampl to be the same mass . also the amount time you let the sampl sit ha to be the same then you would have to remov the sampl and complet clean them .
1156	1	3	3	i would need to know the certain type of sampl i would need to us to complet the experi . i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain so i would have unreason result . i would also need to know what type of contain to us in order to complet thi experi whether it it is big medium or small . it would also help to show the problem so i would understand what i am try to investig .
1157	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi the student need to write in detail a hypothesi for the experi list the materi and sampl need and write out a conclus to what those result to the experi ar
1158	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi i would need the marbl limeston wood and plastic to be the same start mass that wai i could tell which on is not effect with vinegar easier .
1159	1	2	2	some addit inform would be tell at the start of the procedur what you ar us as materi tell what the three sampl ar and . describ how much vinegar goe into each contain .
1160	1	2	2	in order to duplic thi procedur we would need more piec of inform . we would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . we also need to know what the sampl ar for the experi . third we need to know that we ar find a differ in mass from start to finish .
1161	1	3	3	in order to replic the group s experi i would have to know more inform . for exampl it sai to put vinegar but it doesn t sai the measur of how much would be need . it would also have to sai what type and what size contain to put the vinegar in . lastli the procedur would also have to sai what type of sampl thei would be place insid the contain with vinegar .
1162	1	0	0	the addit inform i would add would be what wa the start befor the whole process befor the eu hour occur .
1163	1	3	2	the addit inform you would need to replic thi experi would be how much of each sampl and what kind . you would also need to know how thei determin the mass . you would also need to know how much vinegar thei us in each cup . it would also be help to know what kind of environ the sampl would need to be in .
1164	1	1	1	the piec thei forgot to includ were how much vinegar did thei us to test each sampl and also how much wa each sampl us in thi investig . also thei forgot to write how long you need to leav the vinegar in the contain wa in the substanc .
1165	1	1	1	the addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi is to gather all the materi . tell how much distil water how big each contain wa . p record data .
1166	1	1	1	the addit inform need is the amount of vinegar in each sampl the amount of sampl pour in each contain and in the end of the experi the procedur doe not tell you to weigh the end sampl without thi inform you cannot fulfil thi lab to get the data record in the tabl .
1167	1	1	1	to uptak thi group experi i would need an addit inform . i would need to know how much vinegar to add the contain also i need to know how much of each sampl to pour in the contain . and lastli i would need to know what to unlik on the contain .
1168	1	3	3	the first thing i would add to the experi is that the vinegar should be measur the same amount for all . also the procedur should saw what the differ sampl ar marbl limeston wood plastic . also after place the sampl into contain i believ the contain should be place in the same locat temperatur as the other .
1169	1	0	1	which materi you ar us for the experi also record their mass befor the vinegar and also when it s in the vinegar . you also might want to mass the cup fill with vinegar to see how much gram it had gain with the materi .
1170	1	0	1	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is the sampl . the start mass the end mass and the time . also the differ in mass .
1171	1	3	2	in order to make the group s experi more replic the first thing that should be done is to includ the thei materi us as independ variabl . secondli how much vinegar should be ad to each sampl thirdli in order to both make the experi more replic and improv the valid a control should be test . in an experi like thi the control could be either the end materi left dry or thei can be sort in distil h o .
1172	1	2	2	to replic thi procedur you would need to know mani thing . for instanc you would need to know how big the contain might contain each separ sampl were you would also need to know how much vinegar wa place in the contain . you would also need to know how mani mr the group repeat the procedur to know if is wa accur .
1173	1	1	1	after read the group procedur to replic thi experi i would need inform such as the amount of vinegar us to make acid rain i would also need a control group as well as do the experi at least more time to have more accur conclus .
1174	1	2	2	the chang thei could make ar p have an exact amount of vinegar thei us in each contain . p thei should repeat the experi more then on time . p and thei should make sure thei have the same size of each materi .
1175	1	1	2	you would need to write down in the procedur to record the start mass and the end mass . you would also need to record the time that the sampl were be list . last is how would need to determin what kind of contain the sampl wa be shown in .
1176	1	1	1	first you would need to gather all of your materi . that is import becaus you don t want to start an experi and not have everi thing readi . second you need measur of how much vinegar or everi experi would be differ . lastli you need to remind to make a control group to compar result .
1177	1	1	1	you would need the the for sampl rock vinegar but what we don t know is how much vinegar fore the plastic contain put the rock in the contain in differ and then tape and label what kind of rock then pour vinegar leav for hour to dry to us which stone is better after hour time to longer from the contain leav stone sit for min to dry so that thei can be examin but each or that you should measur the mass of rock in amount of vinegar that be put in then after hour measur mass and record all the data .
1178	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi you would need to have to add some step . a few step that were miss would be the amount of vinegar pour in each cup how long to rins the distil water and also where to let these sampl dry off at .
1179	1	0	0	chang the amount of have . p leav the sampl to sit and dry for more or less than minut . p pour vinegar in each of for separ but differ contain .
1180	1	1	1	on thing you would need to know to replic the experi is what the temp of the vinegar wa becaus that can affect your result . anoth thing you would need tokyo wi how much vinegar wa put into each contain becaus that could also chang the result . the last thing you would need to know is what thei weigh the object on becaus if you us anoth type of scale it could chang your result .
1181	1	3	3	some other inform you would need in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar you would put in each contain how big should the sampl be in question and how much water do you rins it with in question also the student can describ or tell you what kind of contain to us like a dealer or a test tube .
1182	1	2	2	the addit inform that would be need in order to replic the experi is the name of the differ sampl . the amount of vinegar that each contain would need . and you would have to have label each contain in order to know what sampl where go into which contain .
1183	1	1	1	the group should includ more inform about what problem thei ar investig there is noth whatsoev about the statement of what thei ar try to figur out anoth thing need to replic the experi would be the amount of marbl limeston wood and plastic . the student need to sai exactli how much of each of these substanc thei us . thei would also need to specifi the amount of vinegar that wa pour into the contain so that there is and an exact ident amount .
1184	1	0	0	you would need at least contain some vine war and label sticker . also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass .
1185	1	1	1	these student should sai what the sampl s were that thei us . for exampl thei could sai for step on that you obtain a marbl limeston piec of wood and a piec of plastic . i would need the four sampl s in order to complet thi task . secondli i would need vinegar in four separ contain . lastli i need distil water for the sampl s and i would need a weight measur to check the mass of all four or ani sampl .
1186	1	0	0	mayb put more mass in the wood and leav it in longer than year and period in for minut .
1187	1	0	0	in order to duplic thi experi i would need to determin the start mass end mass and differ in mass .
1188	1	0	1	after read the student procedur i though that thei need to add some thing in their graph . what about the hour didn t thei sai after hour but did thei do thi experi at school becaus if thei did then thei can t stai in school for hour a dai . how about the contain lastli neg number in mass i never knew that you can have neg gram .
1189	1	0	0	well thei all got diffid number of there project caus of the marshal got . limeston got . and wood . plastic . for the start mass project .
1190	1	3	3	we would need to know how much vinegar the student us in the experi . we would also need to know what kind of contain thei us . these two bit of inform ar import to know so that we can make sure that the replic sampl were cover with vinegar the same as the origin . we would also need to know the dimens of the sampl becaus a chang in surfac area would greatli alter the experi for if an object ha a higher surfac area to volum ratio it will dissolv more quickli than a sampl with a lower ratio . lastli we need to know the concentr of the vinegar .
1191	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much of the sampl is put in also how much vinegar to pour in . i would also need to know what i am measur the mass in gram etc . if i had the name of the sampl then it would be easi to replic the experi . thei also need sai where to place the sampl a counter in the sun in the closet thei sai noth . also the biggest of all what am i take thi for
1192	1	1	1	the group s procedur is not veri well done . in order to replic their experi the procedur would need more control variabl . it sai pour vinegar there is no precis measur thi could lead to vari result . the procedur also lack multipl trial . the experi wa onli complet onc . in order to be replic multipl trial as well as control variabl ar need .
1193	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup us also need to know what ma ar take the aid how rang ar the sampl that is a us .
1194	1	3	3	i would need to know how much vine
1195	1	0	0	the reason the procedur is bad becaus thei did not finish .
1196	1	1	0	after read the group s procedur you would need to know the problem in order to formul a hypothesi the materi so that you could directli replic the procedur and the valid of the experi so that you could repeat the experi and conduct further trial in order to perhap achiev more accur result .
1197	1	3	3	it is import to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . it is also import to know how long to rins them with distil water or how much water should be us . the group should also write in their procedur whether or not thei should cover the contain onc thei have the stone and vinegar in .
1198	1	0	0	the procedur that is determin the mass of four differ sampl pour vinegar in each of four separ but ident contain . after of on dai remov and allow the sampl for minut .
1199	1	2	2	to make the procedur correct the group would have need to tell me how much of a sampl i can us or should us . also how much vinegar i should us and the size of the contain without that inform i could not replic thi experi .
1200	1	3	2	in order to appropri replic thi experi you would have to record and compar the result of the differ in mass in all four or if differ substanc . also in thi experi you would have to add to the procedur the temperatur of which the substanc will be present in make sure thei ar all the same . also on piec that have to be ad to thi procedur is the amount of time the sc mean would take to rins the object with distil water . also in thi experi it should be retain the total amount of vinegar that is place into the ident cup and then should be remov after the substanc is taken out .
1201	1	0	0	you ar go to need marbl limeston wood plastic and vinegar .
1202	1	0	0	you will need to do the same step over . but you need to be safe with goug ann mayb goug .
1203	1	3	3	you need to know the amount of vinegar you pour . the size of the contain you ar us . and all sampl must be put in the same area . becaus the temperatur and sunlight s doe chang the result .
1204	1	2	2	some addit inform i would need to repeat thi experi would be the amount of vinegar us in each cup the how much distil water to rins with as well as the amount of time spent rins .
1205	1	3	3	the first thing necessari to replic thi experi would be the amount of vinegar pour into each contain . the second thing necessari would be how long we rins of each sampl with d water . the third thing we would have to know would be the volum of the contain .

1210	1	1	1	the addit inform i need in order to replic the experi is independ and the depend variabl . the materi need to conduct the experi . thi experi also need trial .
1211	1	3	3	on addit piec of inform you would need to replic the group procedur would be the type of vinegar thei were us thi is kei regard the reaction of the sampl solidifi and structur . anoth piec of inform i would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup . lastli i would need to know would be the temperatur at which to start the sampl while emerg in vinegar .
1212	1	2	2	you would need to includ how much vinegar to pair into each contain if you were label each sampl after you wash it with distil water and what kind of sampl thei ar .
1213	1	0	0	what wa the mass after minut . p what wa the mass after hour . p what wa the influenc between each time .
1214	1	2	2	to replic thi experi i would have to know the problem and how much vinegar to pour into each contain . how much water do you rins them with and for how long
1215	1	1	1	in order to duplic thi experi i would need a list of materi what kind of sampl and simpler step .
1216	1	1	1	to replic thi experi you would need to know what sampl to us . it doe not state what sampl were us until the data tabl wa shown .
1217	1	0	0	the mass us differ mass . differ type of materi and differ contain
1218	1	1	1	for the experi you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup . for each sampl i would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sampl should be us .
1219	1	0	0	i ll make sure that when i m go to end the mass i will rememb to not add a later ani chemic or anyth els to the end mass so it won t turn out to be a neg or a zero as the dispos in the mass .

1221	1	0	0	the addit inform you would need is the procedur . you would need the marbl limeston wood and plastic you also need the start end and differ in mass .
1222	1	2	2	indic what materi you ar find the mass of . how much vinegar must be poorer into each contain . record data along the wai is import and not on the procedur .
1223	1	1	1	first the student should have specifi what four sampl to us in the first step . in step the student should have told the reader that the sampl were to be place in the contain contain the vinegar . also it would have been a good idea to have includ a step at the phd in which thei would have to repeat the lab for accuraci .
1224	1	1	1	in thi procedur would need to be given the name of the sampl and also in the procedur thei miss some vital step like gather the materi and also clean up in the end

1289	1	3	3	to replic the experi on would need to know how much vinegar wa us . it would also be help to know what concentr of vinegar wa us . to replic the experi on must know what the sampl were in the procedur and the contain thei were put in .
1290	1	2	2	i would need to know how to measur i sampl . i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade .
1291	1	0	0	hypothesi to take a guess whether the mass of four sampl of thei wa go to be right . p independ depend variabl in the student experi p result the would didn t have ani differ in mass and had the start and end mass were were the same .
1292	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi we should be told the amount of vinegar in m ls and tell what the contain is made of and defin if there need to be a constant temperatur in the hour of it try in an incub .
1293	1	3	3	to replic the group experi you would need to know what size contain the group us to hold the sampl . you would also need to know how long to rins the sampl . you would also want to know how thei dri the materi if you want to get the same data .
1294	1	2	2	in order in replic the experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar pour into the separ four ident contain you would also need to know how the mass of the sampl wa examin where type of scale and should the sampl the measur what substanc ar now indic . all of the crucial element state a hour need to marri out the experi ar not sting or miss not mention the lack of a control to compar result to .
1295	1	2	2	what the sampl ar what type of contain .
1296	1	1	1	addit inform that is need to be abl to replic the experi would be to know how much vinegar is be pour into the differ yet ident contain .
1297	1	1	1	anoth import piec of inform we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup becaus if we pour more vinegar into on cup and a littl into anoth cup the result mai vari .
1298	1	2	1	i would need the size of the contain . how or what the temperatur of the water that thei us to rins the sampl .
1299	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar us how much sampl there wa and what time the experi were perform at .
1300	1	1	3	in order to replic thi experi there ar a few thing that could be done . on would be to sai how larg each sampl should be . it should also includ what type of sampl is be test anoth thing would be to includ how much vinegar to us . anoth good thing would be to have multipl trial .
1301	1	1	1	you would would need to know how mani trial to do for each sampl to make an effect experi . you would need to know what to measur the mass in to it sound reason in the data . also you would need to pour in each of the four separ contain . all thi inform would help produc a success experi .
1302	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would first need to know how much vinegar to us . also the amount of time it suppos to sit for . most importantli you would need to label each contain with the differ in each on .
1303	1	1	1	you should obtain separ contain . and then mass the contain so you can subtract the weight of the contain when you mass the sampl . thi will give you just the mass of the sampl not the sampl and contain combin . the amount of vinegar to add to the sampl should also be determin more clearli .
1304	1	1	1	the group in thi experi can do
1305	1	0	0	you would need vinegar a sampl materi to put into a measur and label them also you would need four ident contain . thi is to replic the start mass end mass and differ in mass . that is what you would need to replic thi experi .
1306	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar that wa pour into the contain . you would also need to know the condit of the space where the sampl were set to dry in if there wa more water vapor in the air and if the sampl even dri complet you would also need to know the densiti of each sampl and if the sampl wa complet submerg or if it wa float on top .
1307	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur and make of the student s data record i would sai that thei ar mostli a few total inform in some for on to replic the experi . on such inform is how much vinegar in some thei us on the sampl also what thei us to determin the mass of the sampl . lastli what type of contain thei us would also be us inform .
1308	1	1	1	i would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup how thei determin the mass and how much of each sampl did thei us in each individu cup .
1309	1	0	0	start mass end mass chang in mass .
1310	1	0	0	the addit inform we would need to replic the experi would be the conclus .
1311	1	2	3	addit inform i would need to repeat thi experi includ which four sampl we ar test how much vinegar to pour into the separ contain how much of the a sampl to put into the vinegar what i would put the sampl in after i remov them and how i would determin the mass of each sampl . these thing ar need to replic the experi exactli or els i would not be abl to know the direct and do the experi the same .
1312	1	2	2	well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each contain an how much of each sampl . an what type of vinegar i would be more specif .
1313	1	3	3	addit inform that i would need in order to replic thi design is the four differ sampl . i would need to know the sampl us to replic thi experi . also i would need to know how much vinegar need to be ad to each stare should it be submerg or not . also i would need to know doe temperatur plai a kei factor what is the temperatur . lastli i would want to know the acid of the acid ana vinegar .
1314	1	2	2	you need to know how much vinegar to add to the contain . you need to know what kind of contain and you also need to know how to measur the sampl .
1315	1	0	0	make a data tabl to record each sampl and the start mass . also record the end mass and the differ in mass . also record the lowest and highest mass .
1316	1	2	2	in order to repeat the experi by look at the procedur on must know what the four sampl ar . the amount of vinegar for each sampl should be known as well . also the person perform the procedur should know how much of each sampl to take and what type of measur to us when determin the mass grain .
1317	1	1	1	with step number two how much vinegar should you pour p with step number three what sampl goe with what contain
1318	1	2	2	the addit inform that we would need is how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separ contain . also it sai to label the contain but what ar we suppos to label . lastli it sai to place a sampl of on materi but it doesn t sai what kind of materi and in the begin it sai to determin the mass of four differ sampl but we don t know what kind sampl . so thei should sai the name of it . there is a lot of inform that is miss from thi procedur .
1319	1	2	2	where do we keep the contain how much vinegar will we us and lastli what type of wood and plastic will we us
1320	1	1	1	the addit inform that the group did not add in wa how much vinegar wa pour in each contain . if each contain had differ mass of vinegar then it will affect the out come of the sampl . you must have the same amount of vinegar in each contain and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accur as possibl .
1321	1	2	2	on thing thei would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cup . anoth thing that thei should add is that the differ cup should have long . thei rins each sampl with distil water .
1322	1	1	1	you would need to know how much vinegar wa us in each contain and how much of a sampl to test in the experi . also if the mass of each sampl is differ for exampl marbl be . gram plastic be . gram and wood be . gram how is the mass of each determin
1323	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi you would need addit inform . you would need to know materi the differ sampl ar how much vinegar wa us whether or not the materi should be complet submerg in the vinegar . without thi inform our data could be differ .
1324	1	0	0	some addit inform would be make sure the sampl is dry to do anyth els . next make sure you get all the data and make a chart .
1325	1	2	3	to replic thi experi project you would need to know what type of contain were us to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the contain . also you would need to know how much each sampl you need to place in the vinegar how much distil water you need to rins it with and how well .
1326	1	1	1	you would need to know what materi the sampl were made of . you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain . you would need to know how much of each sampl to put into each contain .
1327	1	1	1	to replic the experi i d need to know how much vinegar to pour into each sampl . i d also need to know what to label each sampl and how much rain to put in each cup .
1328	1	2	2	i would need to know how big the contain were how much vinegar to us and what amount of each of the sampl to replic the experi .
1329	1	3	3	to repeat the student experi you would need to know addit to the procedur
1330	1	1	2	after read the group procedur sever thing ar need in order for the experi to be replic . first the four differ sampl should be identifi and the desir mass should be specifi . also the amount of vinegar ad to each sampl should be identifi .
1331	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi you need the start mass the end mass and the differ in mass . for exampl the marbl start mass is . the end mass is . and the differ in mass is . . now for the limeston the data the group of student got wa . for start mass . end mass . differ mass now for the wood student got . . start mass . end mass and . for differ mass .
1332	1	2	2	how much vinegar to pour in how much big ar the contain and which type of scale would i us
1333	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi it should be us to know how much mass of each sampl you ar try to start with . each start mass the group us were differ have a signific effect on thi result . you would also want to know how much vinegar the group is put into each contain . also it would be import to know how the group is cover the sampl from the contain . depend on how the sampl ar remov could plai a major role on the final result .
1334	1	1	1	for step two how much vinegar do you pour in p for step four how do you remov the sampl from the contain p for step three what do you label the contain
1335	1	1	1	some addit inform thei could have ad be how much vinegar should be pour into each contain tell how much materi thei us in each contain and state if there hypothesi wa true .
1336	1	2	2	. how much vinegar should go into each contain p . why doesn t it matter which sampl p . doe it matter whether the the contain will affect your result
1337	1	1	0	to replic the experi you would me to have the procedur the materi and the time to do thi project .
1338	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi a few piec of addit inform ar need . you would need to know how much vinegar is be ad to the contain . you would also need to know how much of on materi is consid to be a sampl . it is necessari to know how to label the differ contain sinc thei ar ident .
1339	1	2	2	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi is tell how much vinegar to place into each contain tell the size of each materi such as the marbl limeston wood acid wester . the should also add wa the materi would most like look like after the experi .
1340	1	0	0	three piec of inform you need in order to replic the experi is a hypothesi first to predict what you think will happen . secondli you need the data inform like what thei did in the tabl and third you need your tool which thei obvious had sinc thei alreadi record their data .
1341	1	2	2	in order for someon to replic the experi thi group should have immedi includ the name of the four sampl substanc . also thei should includ inform about how much vinegar to add to each sampl and whether that amount remain constant for all sampl . thi group also fail to inform us of the object of thi experi . when replic thi experi it would not be clear to me the purpos of what i am do and what i am try to figur out .
1342	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar us in each cup . you would also have to includ a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might chang . anoth piec of inform need is where the sampl were place such as a hot environ or a cool on .
1343	1	0	0	you will need to pour vinegar in four new separ but ident contain . then you will need to get four new sampl . and determin the mass for four differ sampl .
1344	1	2	2	for thi experi you would also need to know the equip and the four sampl . what were the sampl and what els did you need to do the experi also mayb a specif place to put the sampl exampl light dark room and temperatur . should you do the experi twice on in light room on dark differ temp . how should the contain be place
1345	1	1	1	to replic thi experi i would need to know what type of nativ i us as so i would need a scope to wight the motiv befor thei get treatment and after to make the step easi thei could have said repeat step for each differ motiv us .
1346	1	2	2	some addit inform would need to know is what sampl i m us which unit i m measur the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup thi is same inform i would need put isn t to evid in the procedur .
1347	1	0	0	you need some pictur and a statement .
1348	1	0	0	let the sampl sit to dry for differ amount of time . p try differ contain not ident differ size shape . p try more than on type of acid besid vinegar . p let sampl sit larger than hour .
1349	1	3	3	in order to replic the group experi you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sampl . also you need to know what kind of contain plastic metal paper thi matter depend on how much vinegar would keep out of . also the mass of the sampl all need to be the same differ matter make differ conclus due to surfac area and such .
1350	1	1	1	to replic the group s experi i would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the contain .
1351	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi the addit inform you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separ contain in step . anoth piec of addit inform would be mention the specif sampl be us in the procedur . a third piec of inform would be how much water you should rins each sampl with after the hour .
1352	1	0	0	well you will need the same amount of object to the other experi so it could be the same .
1353	1	1	1	you would have to see what is the amount of rain . also need all the measur of the vinegar .
1354	1	2	2	to replic thi group experi i would need to know how much vinegar i should us what sampl to us in case the graph wasn t shown then i wouldn t know and lastli i would need to know how to determin the mass . sinc i am unawar of how to determin the mass . in the procedur it should sai determin the mass by . . .
1355	1	0	0	some inform you will need in order to replic the experi is thing such as your hypothesi problem result conclus etc . you will also need to show how you got your result and conclus .
1356	1	3	3	initi in order to do thi experi on would need to know which individu sampl to us and what kind of sampl to us . the student should have includ the amount of vinegar to pour into each contain so the investig would be consist in order for the experi to be accur reproduc . the student should have includ the type and size of the contain the apparatu us to measur the mass of each sampl and includ a list of materi for futur investig
1357	1	2	1	addit inform to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar should be pour into the contain . anoth would be how much distil water should be us to us the sampl . the third would be by what method should the mass of the sampl be determin .
1358	1	0	0	after read the group procedur the addit inform you need is the depend and independ variabl central and content hypothesi and problem statement .
1359	1	1	1	the group is miss a whole in of import detail . i would need to know how much vinegar to us for on
1360	1	0	0	you would need to tell us how long it stai out there .
1361	1	1	1	how do you find the mass what do you measur eon and how much vinegar .
1362	1	0	0	i would need to determin the mass of four differ sampl then i would sampl the marbl of the start mass then i would make sure that i have label of all the sampl of start mass end mass and differ on mass . after hour remov the sampl from the contain and allow it to dry .
1363	1	3	3	other inform
1364	1	0	0	you would to add the label again . then you would have to record your result yet again and then you would check you work .
1365	1	1	2	addit inform need for the group procedur is that the group should have state what kind of sampl were need to perform the experi . what also could have been identifi is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composit the sampl . anoth step that could help a student when replic into mayb have an exact measur of the sampl instead of have each on vari from . . . for exampl mayb have each on wai . to see easier which sampl to affect more by acid .
1366	1	0	0	the group s procedur is wrong becaus thei need more time on do thi experi and if the group just work a littl more harder than thei did befor then thei still have a chanc at pass the experi by take out the marbl and limeston and replac them with paper or someth differ then thei can pass the experi by take some bad materi out and put new materi in .
1367	1	3	3	first you need to know how much vinegar thei us in each sampl cup . secondli the amount of each substanc should be the same . next what kind of contain ar thei place thi substanc up out with a lid or lid too wide
1368	1	3	3	addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi would includ know the amount of vinegar that need to be pour into the contain . i would also need to know what type of contain ar be us and where to put these contain dure the hour wait period . final i would need to know the control of thi experi in order to replic it .
1369	1	1	1	aluminum foil black paper is good to wrap around a cup becaus you could have on cup in ani kind of shape you want to the cup puls us aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet . the ali sum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out .
1370	1	2	3	you would need to know what materi to get . you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup . thei should have told us what to measur the cup with . thei should have also told us what type of contain to us .
1371	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar to pour list of materi to us and how much of each materi .
1372	1	2	3	in order to duplic the experi i would also need to know what were the sampl be us what king of contain i need size . i would also need the inform that tell me to measur the start mass of each sampl .
1373	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur in order to replic thi experi it must includ what type of sampl you need . how much vinegar to us and you need a control to compar the result . a control for thi experi would be to have the four sampl sit in water and find the start and end mass . the procedur should also includ the us of a balanc for determin the mass .
1374	1	3	3	the procedur is miss some critic info . first of all the group doe not sai what the sampl ar so to remak the lab . i would not know what i need to get even though it show it in the tabl thei should have it in the procedur . also the group doe not give detail on how much vinegar to put in the contain . final the group did not sai the size of the contain .
1375	1	3	3	on piec of inform that would be necessari if replic thi experi is how much vinegar wa us . you would also need to know how much of each sampl you would place in the cup . you might also want to know what size cup wa us so that the person conduct the experi could do if exactli the same . on other piec of inform that would be help is know how long for us the sai so that each sampl is get the same amount of h . o appli .
1376	1	1	1	you would need someth that measur more then measur it after the time is up there differ color cup so it easi to tell the differ between the three cup in the same temperatur becaus the temperatur can slow and speed up the process .
1377	1	3	3	there ar sever thing thi group should have includ in their procedur . thei did not specifi what type of contain or how larg . thei did not sai what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the contain . thei did not sai what to do with the contain when you finish . thei did not specifi how thei determin the mass .
1378	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need to show in order to replic the experi is how much vinegar to us why thi experi is be done . what is the purpos of thi experi if so i would need to know the type of materi to us .
1379	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into into each contain what utensil to us to measur the mass of the each sampl and what materi should be measur i . e marbl limeston
1380	1	2	2	in order to complet the experi it would be necessari to know what the four materi actual ar . the procedur simpli refer to these unknown substanc as sampl or materi . also it is not know how much vinegar to us for each substanc . lastli it is import to know how much of each substanc to us . these three factor ar import in carri out thi procedur and experi .
1381	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what the sampl of the materi is you need to control group and you need to what you label to your contain .
1382	1	2	2	thi procedur is lack import inform which is need in order to replic the experi . the necessari sampl marbl limeston wood and plastic ar not list in the procedur . the amount of vinegar that on must pour in each contain is also not state . these ar all need in order to determin the mass of each sampl . marbl limeston wood and plastic .
1383	1	2	2	some addit inform you would need a control . you would also need to have the measur of how much vinegar your put into each of the sampl . anoth thing is you would have to list the sampl that you ar test in your procedur .
1384	1	0	0	addit inform that should be ad and to be start with is a brief introduct of the experi and the purpos of it . what kind of mass should be ad in so that can caus confus . the wai i know what were the mass wa the student data that wa record . the procedur should also state exactli what need to be record like start and end mass and the differ in mass .
1385	1	2	2	addit inform you would need to be the exact measur of the vinegar you ar pour in own cup . you would also need to measur the amount of vinegar after the hour sit . also you would need to know what temperatur the contain would need to be place out to receiv the most eros .
1386	1	3	3	in order to replic thi experi thoroughli on would need to know the approxim size of each sampl as a inch block of wood and a cm block would react differ . also ar would need to know how how much vinegar to put in each cap and what the condit of the room were when you leav the sampl for hour .
1387	1	0	0	well think that you would need all of the same step in the procedur to repeat it . but don t have to find the mass between each object .
1388	1	0	0	you will need the data chart also the procedur of the experi to replic it .
1389	1	2	2	i want to know how the experi is relat to acid rain becaus there is no introduct to describ the purpos . p how much vinegar would i pour into the beaker . p what materi do i need to conduct the experi
1390	1	0	0	i would need to know what the outcom wa suppos to be or what it wa suppos to look like . the inform given is good but doesn t realli explain why thei were do thi experi for but the tabl wa good and understand .
1391	1	2	2	how much vinegar ar the pore how long ar we rins them
1392	1	1	1	the inform not includ in the procedur that should be state is the amount of vinegar ad to each of the contain .
1393	1	1	1	to replic the experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sampl . in order to get accur result you would
1394	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur on thing thei could add is to specifi in the st step what thei re test . for exampl thei could have said determin the mass of marbl limeston wood and plastic . anoth thing thi group could have done is to conduct more trial of the experi so that thei could get valid result . final anoth thing thi group could have said in their procedur make it easi to replic is by specifi the amount of vinegar someon should put in each of the contain .
1395	1	1	1	what i would add in the procedur is that i what ar the materi you need record your data what is your conclus what did you come up with .
1396	1	1	1	the addit inform you would need to replic thi experi is how much vinegar need to be put in each contain . an addit piec of inform that would help replic thi experi is how long should you rins each rock for becaus some rock mai absorb water which would add on some weight .
1397	1	2	2	you would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each contain how much each sampl should be includ in each contain where to place the contain and then where to place the sampl dure the their in the contain and out .
1398	1	0	0	after read the procedur i would like to know the time given for each materi . also if their were ani color chang and what wa ad to the materi .
1399	1	2	2	thei should also add in the control group to undergo the experi as well . p thei also should indic the amount of vinegar thei wa ad into each sampl . p thei should measur the temperatur at what thei dri their sampl .
1400	1	1	1	after read the group s procedur addit inform i would need to replic the experi to the differ type of sampl i would us what to label the sampl and what should i measur in .
1401	1	2	2	in order to replic thi group experi you would need some addit inform . you would need to know what the start mass of the three object were you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each contain and you would need to know how long to rins each contain after let them sit each for hour .
1402	1	0	0	you would need more vinegar and marbl limeston wood and plastic to replic the experi .
1403	1	2	2	the second step should state how much vinegar is us . in step four how much vinegar is us . in step four the amount of distil water and time us to rins each sampl should be state .
1404	1	2	2	on addit price would be to state the materi need nosier addit pele would be to identifi how much vinegar is be pour in the contain anoth addit peac would be to mari all the materi the same end mass .
1405	1	3	3	i would need to know what were the four differ sampl . how much vinegar to pour into the four separ contain . also what to label the contain and should i leav the contain at room temperatur or put it somewher els for the whole hour .
1406	1	3	3	to replic thi procedur you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . it would also be us to know if the temperatur of the room should be . lastli thei should tell you what size of each sampl you should be take . if thei do not add in these thing the experi mai have a differ result when done by someon els .
1407	1	2	2	the addit inform that you would need in order to replic the experi ar what type of climat the contain have to be in the size of the contain and the thick of the insul materi .
1408	1	0	0	addit inform you would need would be to put more time . a sampl to write down the start time end time try other sampl next time .
1409	1	0	0	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know p . how thei got the mass of the four differ sampl p . a list of constant p . you would have to know how much of a sampl you would place into the contain of vinegar and if it s the same for all four materi .
1410	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need is to know what size the contain should be . i would need to know what to label the contain . also how much vinegar i have to put in to each contain .
1411	1	3	2	for thi experi i would want to know how much vinegar i should pour into the cup . pour differ amount could chang the mass . the other inform i would need is if i need to rins the materi in a time manner sec sec etc . thi could also effect the mass of the materi . i would also need to know if the amount of the sampl had to be the same size . that also could effect the differ of the mass s .
1412	1	0	0	wood start mass g .
1413	1	3	3	if someon is go to repeat thi lab the procedur should includ that type of materi ar us . if be repeat the person do it might not us the same materi . also the amount of vinegar us in each contain should be in there . thei should also specifi that type of contain ar us . mayb restrain type affect the experi and some don t and thei should then made note of that
1414	1	3	3	in order to replac the experi yale would need addit inform includ four differ sampl of what specif materi . moreov yale would need to know the temperatur at which the sampl were kept . lastli how much vinegar is react for each individu sampl .
1415	1	3	3	the group of student need to add how big or small the contain should be . anoth item that the student did not add wa how much vinegar goe in each contain . the group also forgot to mention what sampl thei ar us . without these main inform point nobodi could replic thi lab .
1416	1	2	2	to replic thi experi we would need to know how much vinegar the sampl were in how much of each sampl and what type of contain ar be us .
1417	1	1	1	sampl of what and what is the purpos of the experi why should we do it what do we have to do with the data .
1418	1	3	3	addit inform need to replic the experi would be how much vinegar wa ad to each of the four separ contain . also you might sai how long to rins the sampl under distil water for . final the student should also state where to place each cup dure the experi and to dry . you need to know whether it should be in a cold wet environ or mayb warm dry .
1419	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi procedur should includ the name of the four differ sampl the amount of vinegar that should be pour in each cup and the size of the four ident contain .
1420	1	1	1	in their procedur thei would also have to includ on how to find the differ in mass . thei would have to state that you need to subtract the start mass from the end mass . in order to replic thi investig it is necessari to know now much vinegar is need in each of the contain . we would also need to know what the unit ar if their gram and mr .
1421	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur some addit inform i would need in order to replic thi experi is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separ but ident contain . also you would have to know what the sampl materi is that you ar place in each of the contain and final you would have to mass out each individu contain in order to get the actual mass for each sampl and the mass of the sampl to contain .
1422	1	0	0	first in order to repeat the experi i would have to know what s there investig about and how much of the singl sampl ar we support to but in the contain .
1423	1	2	2	some inform need is that thei should tell us what the sampl ar what to measur them in and how much vinegar to us becaus it will chang the experi alon by not ad the same amount .
1424	1	0	0	don t know .
1425	1	3	3	after read the procedur some thing ar still unclear . thei should sai what sampl ar be test not just mass sampl . also how much vinegar should we pour and in what sort of contain what should we label the contain as how should the sampl be remov from the contain and as alwai what ar the materi we need and our there ani import thing to note regard lab safeti .
1426	1	2	1	some addit inform that i would need would be how much vinegar do i pour into the contain in what measur do i measur the four sampl .
1427	1	1	1	on thing that thei need to put in their wa the amount of vinegar and what wa the point of do these .
1428	1	0	0	the three thing that need to be ad to replic thi experi is to place marbl limeston wood and plastic each in a differ cup fill with vinegar . at the begin you need to determin the mass of a piec of limeston marbl wood and plastic . at the end after you determin the mass calcul the differ in mass by subtract the first mass of limeston marbl wood and plastic by by the end mass of each .
1429	1	2	2	to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar need to be pour into each contain . i would also need to know firsthand what my sampl ar i don t want to look for them in the result .
1430	1	1	1	thei would also need to includ how much vinegar wa need to add to the sampl . thei also need to includ how much of each sampl there should be and that you need to find the differ of the mass at the end of the procedur .
1431	1	2	2	to be abl to replic thi experi the group would need to add what each sampl is . thei should also includ at what temperatur stai left the sampl at and lastli thei should also add that thei must record their data in tabl so that all the inform is clear .
1432	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know specif what materi to start with and the amount of vinegar that i should pour into the four cup . i would also need to know where to store the cup . it would be help to know what techniqu that thei us to rins each sampl as well . much more inform is need in order to accur replic thi experi .
1433	1	3	3	in abl to replic thi procedur step must be ad p what ar the sampl . p how much vinegar is pour into the contain . p what unit of measur is us to measur it mass . p what kind of contain were us .
1434	1	0	0	you need a mean cup the nearer the mass of energi . then we get plastic of start mass .
1435	1	1	1	the addit inform that i would need to know is how would i find the mass of ani of the materi how much vinegar do i pour in each of the contain what do i do to the materi or contain befor i let them sit for hour
1436	1	1	1	on wai thei could be more clear is by us how much vinegar into the contain . also thei can write ho to much of the differ ar need and if you need to place the sampl in a certain pt .
1437	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know a few thing suppos the ph of acid of the vinegar . the surfac area of the rack can also affect thi experi becaus the more surfac area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solut thi contact make on each dissolv faster then a rack with less of a surfac area .
1438	1	1	1	a . tell how much vinegar you us . p b .
1439	1	2	2	i would need to know how much of vinegar do i put in the contain how long do i rins the sampl for .
1440	1	1	1	what ar you go to do after you find the mass of all four sampl . how much vinegar did you put in each sampl .
1441	1	0	0	to replic thi experi and make if beef you will have to have va i in more accur inform an conclus and a graph .
1442	1	3	3	addit inform need to replic thi experi would includ p what kind of four sampl ar be us . p how much vinegar to pour into the contain . p what kind of contain ar be us . p how to to remov the sampl and place them into contain . p what to label each of the separ contain .
1443	1	2	2	first of all in order to replic thi experi you need to know what the materi ar . also the on try to replic the experi need to know the exact mass of the sampl . final the procedur must tell the on conduct the experi the exact amount of vinegar to us .
1444	1	3	3	to replic their experi there ar three piec of inform miss . how much vinegar thei us how big the contain were and what thei were made of and what sampl thei us . if thei ad those thing in the procedur you would be abl to replic their experi .
1445	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi it would be import that we know the specif all of the vinegar which is acid therefor it would be below it . we would also need to know what type of wood is be us in the experi . final the most import aspect of the experi that would need to be determin befor replic would be the amount of vinegar solut that each sampl wa place in the type of plastic is also import to know .
1446	1	1	1	more inform that i need is what materi did thei put into the contain becaus thei did tell us and thei didn t what thei did after thei let it sit for hour and befor thei rins the contain . also thei didn t label each measur on the chart .
1447	1	0	0	in order to be abl to redo thi experi you need to have all of the inform . we need to know more about how thei did thi experi . more detail is better .
1448	1	0	0	the addit inform that is need is how thei record the experi . thei need to separ that experi more when mac . alwai miner the determin and compar it to the fire time that you did the experi . tell what happen how in the first experi .
1449	1	1	1	to replic thi experi you would need to includ piec of addit inform . the group of student neglect to specifi how much of vinegar that would be pour into each of the contain . when you have put a measur in your procedur it make it alreadi more ideal to replic the experi .
1450	1	0	0	to replic the experi i would need to know the time at which thei began and the time thei end at .
1451	1	3	3	to replic thi experi you would need to know how mani mr of vinegar to us . you would also need to know how much distil water to rins the sampl with . to replic thi experi you would need to know what type of contain to us to put the sampl in . the type of sampl also need to be state in the procedur not onli in the result .
1452	1	1	1	after ad i determin that
1453	1	1	1	the group wa miss how much vinegar thei us . more trial for each materi would improv thi lab .
1454	1	1	1	how much vinegar do you put in the cup
1455	1	2	2	thei should describ what the sampl ar how much vinegar do you put in each contain .
1456	1	2	2	three addit piec of inform i would need would be the size of the sampl how much vinegar pour in each contain and i would need a tripl beam befor to measur .
1457	1	3	3	the addit inform need would be pheasant of vinegar that goe into each contain . you will also need to know where ar suppos to leav the sampl . thei should also includ if the sampl should be cover or not and includ where to dry the sampl .
1458	1	3	3	to replic thi experi i would need to know how much vinegar to us how big of a sampl to us and how long to rins each sampl . without these you cannot replic the experi .
1459	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of each sampl that is put into the contain . i would also need to know the environ in which the contain where dure the hour . thing such as temperatur ar necessari . i would also need to know how long the sampl should be rins after the hour .
1460	1	2	2	first their procedur need to identifi what sampl ar be test . also thei would need to specifi the amount of vinegar in each contain in step . the experi is also miss a control to compar each sampl to . without a control we don t know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason .
1461	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need to complet thi experi is thi . first i would need to know which on to put in first second how long should i wa wish water . then final where should i let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out . so that is the addit inform i would need to complet thi experi .
1462	1	1	1	addit inform that is need to replic the experi is how much vinegar is pour into the contain how much materi is need into the contain and how much of the sampl do i need .
1463	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar should be pour in each of the four sampl . i also need to know how much is the start mass of each sampl and how much is the end mass of each sampl in order to determin the mass of each sampl .
1464	1	0	0	tell us to do it again .
1465	1	2	3	on thing i would need to know is how much vinegar thei pour into each contain . also i would also need to know how long i would rins the materi off far . final i would a need to find out what thei us to dry or did thei leav it on the tabl .
1466	1	3	3	in order to replic thi as the group procedur would need to includ what the four item thei ar test and the group would also need to includ the volum of vinegar which the four sampl were ad to . on last thing that would need to be specifi is the convers of the vinegar . if when the experi is replic and a differ concentr of vinegar is us differ result mass occur .
1467	1	0	1	sai what kind of materi there us . why there do ar experi .
1468	1	2	2	to do thi experi you need to know what the sampl ar how much vinegar to us what do you label the contain and how do you determin the mass
1469	1	2	1	in order to replic thi experi on would need to know sever thing . first the amount of vinegar ad would have to be specifi . second on would have to observ chang in color and size of the sampl if ani . third the procedur doesn t tell you to find the differ in mass which you should .
1470	1	3	3	the student should have includ inform about what the sampl were what type of vinegar to us and how much vinegar to us .
1471	1	3	2	the group will need to put to the follow inform . what ar the four differ sampl . what type of contain will be need . also what size . thei will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar . the temperatur should be consist
1472	1	2	2	i would need the type of sampl materi that ar be us . it doe not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the contain so i would need a measur of how much vinegar to put in . final i would also need to know what type of equip i would us to measur the mass .
1473	1	2	2	to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each contain . also for the wood sampl you would need to know the type of wood be us . last you would need to know the size of the contain be us and how to determin the mass of the sampl .
1474	1	3	3	to replic these student experi you would have to know what the sampl ar of that you re us . you would also have to know where you re leav these contain . and lastli to replic thi experi you mai need to know the type of contain you re put these in that and or the size of the origin sampl .
1475	1	2	2	to replic the group experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa pour on the sampl as well as how much water you rins the sampl with . you might also want to know what temperatur thi experi wa done in as temp affect the result of them rins .
1476	1	3	3	to repeat thi lab i would need to know what kind of vinegar thei us . how much vinegar thei us and if the contain wa cover or not .
1477	1	2	1	after read thi procedur other addit inform you would need to replic the experi is in the procedur thei should state the materi that there go to be test instead of sai sampl . anoth is thei should have more control valuabl instead of other sampl posit for min thei should have more to determin what to do with sampl and contain . thei should have a control to test the result and see how thi vari against the control . thi is the same inform i would need to replic the experi .
1478	1	0	0	so far in the procedur thei tell you into determin the mass of sampl pour vinegar into each cup . let silt for hour take sampl sit and dry them . you would then receiv the end mass and subtract the differ .
1479	1	2	2	to replic thi experi the inform we need is the amount of vinegar that thei pour into each cup . anoth piec of inform we need is what kind of sampl thei ar becaus if the data tabl wa carri the water could not follow the procedur . the procedur doe not state what the sampl ar . the last piec of inform we need is what ar we go to us to determin the mass after it sit of minut . it doe not tell what instrument we need to find the mass .
1480	1	3	3	on thing you would need to know is what us of contain you need . in step thei do not sai the size of the contain thei just said you need them . also in step on it just sai to determin the mass of four differ sampl that is veri unclear becaus it doe not tell you what sampl to measur . as in step two it doe not tell you the amount of vinegar to pour into the contain .
1481	1	3	2	to replic the acid aim experi the sampl in step on should be identifi to make the direct more clear . there should be a set and constant amount of vinegar and the amount of time the sampl ar rins should be includ . it should also sai how to find the mass whether to us water and a graduat cylind or a tripl beam balanc .
1482	1	0	0	in order to repeat thi experi you would need an electron balanc to measur the mass cup to put the sampl in and water to distil each sampl with .
1483	1	2	2	the group need to add the name of the sampl that thei ar us . thei also need to sai how much vinegar thei need to pour in each contain . the experi also need a control as evid to show that some reaction is actual happen .
1484	1	2	2	you would need to know how much of each substanc wa us in order to replic the experi . you would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the sampl becaus if you us differ amount then the result mai not be the same as the origin . thirdli how larg each contain should be becaus if the contain ar too small some of the sampl mai leak out and ruin the result for the acid rain lab .
1485	1	2	2	although thei got some inform i think that in order to replic the experi thei would need thing . the first thing would be to determin how much vinegar you put into each of the contain . secondli to determin the amount of distil water us to wash off vinegar lastli to determin where the sampl were stai for hour . if thei were to replic thi experi and did these exampl that i have list than it would be success .
1486	1	2	1	the group didn t sai what the sampl ar for their experi in the procedur . thei also should have sai how much vinegar would be pour into each contain . thei should tell how much of each sampl would be us in each contain .
1487	1	1	1	thei need to measur the amount of vinegar and onli put in on contain . you need to measur the mass clearli not just estim . you get the mass befor you do anyth to it .
1488	1	0	1	the addit inform i would need to replic the experi is the materi all the step that thei did .
1489	1	2	2	to replic the experi you would need to add control variant . you will need to make sure that thei all stai at the same temperatur thought the experi . also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is us in each .
1490	1	2	2	the student could state how much vinegar is need in each contain explain weather the sampl need to be submers complet or not .
1491	1	0	0	after read the group s procedur to replic thi experi i would need a scale four ident contain vinegar a sampl of marbl a sampl of limeston a sampl of wood a sampl of plastic a stop watch water and label .
1492	1	3	3	in order to replic th experi the student will need to add thing . what type of wood plastic limeston and marbl so for exampl th wood thy us is hard than the wood you us . how much vinegar need to be pour in it enough to cover it or not . also what sir contain . anoth thing to chang how long is each sampl rins for so some don t absorb more or less water . and final what temperatur doe th sampl dry at becaus in higher or lower temperatur or humid environ th sampl mai dry at a differ speed .
1493	1	0	0	i think the project need to chang
1494	1	0	0	first the state mass should of been the same . it s know a product that thei did noth to thei did chang anyth you can chang the time .
1495	1	0	0	it didn t give enough inform .
1496	1	2	2	in order to complet thi experi there ar sever step that need to be ad to the procedur . for instanc in the begin of the procedur you need to explain what you would mass out the sampl with and specif which sampl . also you need to know how much vinegar to put into the contain . in step the procedur doe not explain how you would rins the sampl or at what temperatur to do it at these variabl if left out of the procedur can be the result of less accur result .
1497	1	0	0	gather materi . p pour ml vinegar in each of four separ out ident contain . p place a samoa of the materi into the contain and label . repent with remain place a strike sampl into a singl contain . p after hour remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . p allow the sampl to sit and dry for minut . p determin the mass of each . p clean up where you work .
1498	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know how much vinegar wa pour into the contain and i d also need to know what the volum of the separ but ident contain were i would also need to know how much water distil wa us to rins off the sampl and for how long did the student rins the sampl i mai also need to know with what in statement the sampl were mass in order to replic the experi .
1499	1	0	0	the addit inform you would need to know is you would need to know if the rock wa sit in the vinegar or be shaken . if shaken you would need to know how hard to shake it . differ prospect ar creat
1500	1	3	3	after read thi group experi i have found that to do thi experi over again i would need addit inform addit inform would need would includ what kind of contain do i put the materi in what size contain wa us to put the materi in what surfac or what do i ar the materi with and how much vinegar would i put in the if separ contain i would need all thi inform to perform of thi experi .
1501	1	1	1	in order to do thi procedur perfectli you will have to know what the suppli and materi ar befor you begin . in order to have a valid trial of data i would have experi for the rest of the sampl .
1502	1	2	2	after read the group s procedur i notic thei didn t measur how much vinegar to pour in each contain know the measur will help the experi be more exact . anoth wai to improv thi experi is to have more trial becaus there wa onli on for each sampl . anoth is where should the sampl sit in sun or indoor thi mai have an affect .
1503	1	1	1	the group of student didnt tell us the differ sampl nor did their procedur tell you to find the start mass and the differ in the start mass and end mass .
1504	1	1	1	you need the type of materi need the amount of materi in order to mix the sampl and have step in two differ step in order to understand it .
1505	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need to know in order to repeat thi experi is to know the amount of vinegar in each contain the mass of the four sampl and to know what ar the four sampl us in the experi . i would need these piec of inform so i can repeat thi experi .
1506	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup and that the amount remain constant throughout the experi . you would also need to know how much distil water wa us to rins the sampl .
1507	1	1	1	a control variabl is on of the most import thing to includ in the procedur and thi group did not do so . the procedur should also includ how much of the vinegar solut should be pour into the contain becaus a differ in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcom . it would also be a good thing to mention to record your inform so that you won t forget it later on in the experi .
1508	1	2	2	in the procedur it doe not tell you what the sampl ar if you need to us
1509	1	2	3	there is much addit inform necessari in these procedur in order for on to be abl to repeat it in step the four sampl should be specifi as marbl limeston etc as thei were in the data tabl . in step how much vinegar ie in ml should be describ as well as the type of contain a jar plastic beaker etc also in step i determin the mass could be also tri more by sai what type of measur should be us such as beam . lastli there should be a step direct us to find the differ in mass as it doe in the data tabl .
1510	1	2	2	in order for me to replic thi experi i would need to know at what temperatur these sampl were kept . i would also need to know the size of the contain so all three can have the same amount . lastli i feel that i would need to know what to measur the mass with . by know thi inform i would be abl to replic the experi .
1511	1	2	2	the addit inform i would need to replic the experi would be to identifi each sampl . also i would need to know much vinegar to pour into each contain .
1512	1	2	2	thi experi will need more trial to see if the result ar convinc . the group need to add a specif measur of vinegar ad to the materi . thei need to add how long thei rins each sampl after the hour is up .
1513	1	3	3	what the sampl ar how much vinegar should be ad to each contain where the sampl ar contain for the hr wait period .
1514	1	1	1	want wise the shop if thei wage with the that thei wa hold the thing if it wa dry how much rins did put in it .
1515	1	0	0	the inform that you will need is the measur hypothesi conclus becaus you want necessarili find out what will happen next without these three thing . these ar the main thing you need to replic the experi .
1516	1	1	1	you would need the name of the sampl you were us .
1517	1	3	3	to repeat the experi i would have to know much vinegar i am pour into contain . i need to know room temperatur or temperatur to see p it affect it also how long do we rins the sampl for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a littl wet .
1518	1	2	2	the student need to have ident materi for thi could valid the experi becaus mass ha an effect on vinegar dissolut . a quantiti of vinegar need to be specifi as some mai be dissolv quicker with more solut . final the temperatur of the area in which the experi is be conduct need to be note becaus some mai work better in heat or cold . a constant temperatur need to be known for the experi to be valid .
1519	1	3	3	the procedur given doesn t have enough inform so that someon could replic it . what els is need is to state the differ sampl need . it also need to identifi how much vinegar goe into each contain for the sampl . lastli we need to know what kind of contain how big each of them ar .
1520	1	3	3	you would need the specif amount of vinegar us for the experi to replic it . you would also need to know what the specif sampl were and the volum of the contain so that the experi would be replic .
1521	1	2	2	some addit inform i would need to replic thi experi would be a certain a mount of vinegar i would need to put into each cup exactli what materi i am to add in each of the four cup and also how to remov the sampl from the contain .
1522	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi you would need to know what materi were us the amount of vinegar that is need and exactli how the group measur the mass both befor and after the experi .
1523	1	0	0	the student have to measur the four differ sampl when thei remov the sampl from the contain and rins each sampl with distil water . thei have to measur befor the end mass becaus it mai differ than the end mass .
1524	1	1	1	addit inform that you would need to replic thi experi is to rememb to write in the procedur to record data . also name the four differ sampl you will be work with . also make sure you work with on sampl at a time .
1525	1	3	3	i would includ what the sampl ar wood marbl etc and would label the contain that wai . i would includ the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar us . i would also includ at what temperatur the sampl were kept at .
1526	1	1	1	after read the group procedur the addit inform that i would need to replic thi experi would be a control . thei don t have anyth to compar their data to thei should have us acid rain and distil water as there experi . also thei didn t show the number of trial which should be more than on so thei could get an averag and get more valid data . the group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of on materi in each cup . i have an idea how much on materi is .
1527	1	0	0	to replic thi experi you would need to state you problem . what is the person for thi lab also you need to indic your independ and depend variabl .
1528	1	3	3	first you would need to know what materi to us as sampl . second you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each contain . lastli you would need to know what condit to keep the contain at .
1529	1	1	1	know all the materi thei us and what the wight of each of the materi were befor thei were place in the water .
1530	1	2	2	the amount of vinegar state in procedur z . p the type of contain for each substanc . p how much distil water you would need to rins
1531	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each contain how to label the contain and how long to rins the sampl for .
1532	1	0	0	two sampl of each materi must be collect make two chart on for your first trial and on for the second . calcul the averag from your two trial .
1533	1	1	1	after read the group procedur the addit inform need to replic the experi is a control becaus there is no control in the experi . the type of contain need to be known becaus the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorb . also thei do not mention how much the sampl ar record so their experi cannot be repeat with the hope of have the same result .
1534	1	3	3	some addit inform you would need to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar should be put in each contain . if not specifi someon mai put too littl or too much and the result can come out veri differ . you would also need to know how much of each sampl you need to put in the contain and you need to know how long to rins each sampl and where the sampl should dry .
1535	1	3	3	if i want to replic the experi i would need to know what kind of contain to us i would need to know if i should cover the sampl in the contain i would also need to know what the sampl ar . how am i suppos to know what i am tast if i don t know what the sampl ar .
1536	1	3	3	addit inform that would be need . we need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sampl what temperatur to keep sampl at and how long to rins the sampl for .
1537	1	2	3	i would need to know if there wa ani specif materi we need like special wood or plastic . some other inform i would need is what kind of vinegar thei us white or red . on last thing would be doe it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1538	1	0	0	you need to determin what will happen after the the investig how will it happen need beck down the step .
1539	1	2	2	to properli replic the acid rain experi you would need more inform than is given in the current procedur . you would need to know what materi the four differ sampl ar in step on how much vinegar to put in the separ ident contain in step two nd specifi each sampl goe in it own contain rather than onli pleas in in singl sampl in a singl contain .
1540	1	0	0	in order for me to replic thi group s procedur i would need to have the problem their hypothesi . also the independ and depend variabl .
1541	1	0	0	i think what i will do is to chang the procedur . instead of leav the sampl sit for hour i ll let them sit for hour i ll let them dry for insan
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experi control a problem statement and for precis you need more than on trial for each sampl
1543	1	1	1	to replic the acid rain experi the group would have to includ how much vinegar to pour into the contain what the start mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the sampl ar rins with .
1544	1	0	0	. gather materi . p . put on apron goggl . p . set up materi . p . for vinegar into a ident contain . p . put marbl limeston wood plastic into their separ contain . p . put name on contain wait hour . p . rins the sampl with distil water . p . put sampl out to dry . p . determin the mass other differ . p . clean up materi .
1545	1	2	2	addit inform that is need to replic thi experi would consist of three thing . number on us be the amount of vinegar pour into the four separ beaker . i would also need to know what is the ml size of the ident beaker of size alter or not . the
1546	1	1	1	first off we need to know how we should be measur the mass like with what kind of scale . thei should also specifi what unit we ar us such as gram . thei also don t tell us how much vinegar to pour into these contain .
1547	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know what sampl thei us . anoth piec of inform i would need is how much vinegar do i us for each sampl . lastli i would need to know the question that the group of student ar try to answer .
1548	1	2	2	in the procedur thei never said how to the differ in mass g and what it mean . also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each contain also thei never said what of the sampl were .
1549	1	2	2	on piec of inform need would be what sampl to us as it is not indic in the procedur . anoth would be how much at the sampl to put in the contain . also the procedur doesn t state what temperatur to allow the sampl to sit when thei ar .
1550	1	1	2	thi group left out some import detail when write their procedur . in order to replic thi experi i would also need to show what i would measur the mass with how the amount of vinegar i should put into each contain what the other materi would be . these thing would help me to replic the experi better .
1551	1	3	3	the group neglect to includ what the four differ sampl ar . thei should have said us a scale to determin the individu mass g of four differ sampl of materi marbl limeston wood and plastic . thei also were too vagu in describ put vinegar in contain . thei should have includ how much ml vinegar should be pour into each contain what contain ar made of . thei also never includ how larg in size the sampl should be and did not make a control in the experi to compar the end result to . thei also never list the materi that need to be us .
1552	1	0	0	the wai you would replic the experi is by repeat the procedur but just us a differ sampl ingredi .
1553	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi i would need to know what i would measur to measur the mass with a sale . second i would need to know to measur the mass in gram . third i would need to know if i should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundredth of the gram .
1554	1	1	1	in thi experi thei give all the thing you need to do but not with enough detail . in order to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar goe in each contain . it mai be the same but we need to know a measur . also anoth thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sampl for instanc we don t know if a certain substanc goe in a certain contain . lastli thei don t explain how thei determin the mass . in order to repeat the experi you would have to know what thei us to measur the mass .
1555	1	0	0	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi form a hypothesi . draw a conclus . sai what you ar experi .
1556	1	2	2	after read the procedur some addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi is a clear indic of what the four differ sampl ar . i will also need to know what their control variabl wa and the exact mass that went into each contain . i will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each contain and if thi amount vari between the differ contain .
1557	1	2	2	to replic the procedur you would also need to know that the sampl ar marbl limeston wood and plastic . second thing you need to know is what type of wood becaus some wood ar harder than other the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp .
1558	1	3	2	on thing miss from thi experi is the precis measur of vinegar pour experi . you would also need to have the sampl all the same size . thirdli you need to know the size of the contain when repeat thi experi .
1559	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know which sampl is go in which contain you would need to record all of the mass of each sampl and make sure all the mass ar the same . you would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sampl . after the hour rins sampl and let each sit for minuet you would weigh each sampl again and see which on is most differ in mass .
1560	1	3	3	to repeat the experi you said first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the contain . you would also need to know the amount of each sampl that wa measur to get their mass . you said also need to know if you should cover the sampl and at what temperatur thei should be left to sit in for hour . also what would you do with the sampl onc you remov them from the contain where would thei sit
1561	1	0	0	i will need to collect all of my materi . i will need four contain and my four sampl . i will have to place the four sampl in the contain . then put
1562	1	0	0	if you want to replic the experi you will need more contain exactli alik marbl limeston wood and plastic also fresh cup of vinegar .
1563	1	2	2	addit inform that would be need is how much vinegar wa ad to each sampl how did the student figur out the end mass and where did thei place the sampl in the period of hour .
1564	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi it would have been better if thei put in how much vinegar to go in each contain . thei could shorten the time that each sampl had to stai in a contain . thei could have state how to determin the mass and what unit to us . thei could have also seen specif or what type of contain can be us for the experi .
1565	1	3	3	to replic the acid rain experi you would need to know what size contain to us you would also need to know what the four differ sampl were . lastli you would need to know how long to note sampl for .
1566	1	3	3	after read thi group procedur there ar four differ piec of inform i would need to replic thi exact experi . on the group must includ what the sampl ar anyon read thi procedur would not know what the experi wa test . two you must includ the amount of vinegar be pour into each separ contain . thirdli thei must includ under what condit should the sampl be left for the hour . lastli i would need to know what type of contain these sampl should be place in should thei be put in plastic or glass or even open or close contain
1567	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi on would need to know some addit inform . first of all it would be help to know how much vinegar need to be pour into the contain . also from the student s written procedur on doe not know what materi the sampl ar . that would also be help . lastli it would be import for the student to includ that at the end of the experi that thei took the differ in mass .
1568	1	1	1	in order to replic thi procedur it would have to tell what the sampl ar . there is no wai of correctli replic if the wrong sampl ar us which could happen without proper explan .
1569	1	0	0	thei didn t come up with the independ depend variabl p make up a question p creat a hypothesi
1570	1	3	3	in order to figur out how to replic thi i would need to know the contain size . also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in . i would need to know how long to wash with water for .
1571	1	2	2	some addit inform that would be need ar specif thing . first the procedur can specif give the amount of vinegar that ha to be put in the contain . the experi can also describ the materi sinc the word materi can mean almost anyth . the experi also need a control such as us water instead of vinegar .
1572	1	2	2	to replic thi experi you would need to know how much vinegar wa pour in the contain you would also need to know how to determin the mass of the sampl and you would also need to know more inform on the contain .
1573	1	3	3	after read the procedur in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much of each sampl there wa . also you would need to know what kind of vinegar thei re us as well as how much to pour into the contain . you might also need to know how long to rins each sampl and if it wa with warm or cold water .
1574	1	1	2	first piec of inform i would add is the name of the differ sampl and how much vinegar wa put in to the contain when you start . then when you finish how much vinegar wa in the contain .
1575	1	0	0	addit inform i would need to replic thi experi is how to determin the mass of each sampl also to take the mass of the sampl befor put them in the vinegar to compar the mass of befor vinegar after .
1576	1	1	1	to replic the experi thei would need to know how much vinegar wa put in each contain . thei also need to get rid of the determin the mass of four differ sampl and instead sai measur the start weight of the sampl .
1577	1	1	1	you would also need to includ a list of suppli a hypothesi and amount of how much vinegar and of the sampl is need .
1578	1	1	1	thi group need a control . thei need someth that won t chang . thei also need them to have all the p sampl with the same start mass . lastli i wa never told how much vinegar i should into the contain . p that is import to know becaus you cant guess for how much to put in .
1579	1	2	2	the temperatur thei were left at know what substanc the sampl were what temp the distil water should be .
1580	1	3	3	the group procedur could us thei could add to find the differ in mass at the end . also list the type of sever thei rous . and thei should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar thei rous .
1581	1	3	3	you will need to know the temperatur of which to keep the sampl at . p the surfac ar in each of the sampl expos to the vinegar . p how much vinegar to put the sampl in .
1582	1	0	0	in order for me to replic thi experi i would need to come up with an hypothesi the reason why i am do thi experi and a conclus .
1583	1	0	0	while do thi experi some addit inform that you mai need to know ar what is the reason thei ar do thi experi for what is the problem anoth thing is what is the final answer that thei ar look for thei also need to follow the scientif method in order to complet their investig .
1584	1	1	1	you would need to know how much vinegar is need and what is the purpos of the experi .
1585	1	3	2	in order to replic the experi you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the sampl in how much vinegar you would put each sampl in and how mani time would be need to rins each sampl of the vinegar .
1586	1	0	0	to replic the experi you would need to know the what the previou problem statement wa without a problem statement there is no purpos for do the experi . you would also need to know who the group . . . . hypothesi wa . by know the hypothesi you ll someth to compet with your find . and last the group should have said their control . p thi will give you data to base your exam find onto .
1587	1	3	3	the addit inform that i would need is how much vinegar do you put in the contain what ar the four sampl to put someth over the contain and what ar step of the sampl .
1588	1	0	0	i think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal on and the lowest is . we want to add it up to see what mass is better we need to see what sampl look good becaus you don t want to have a bad on .
1589	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi thei would have to
1590	1	3	2	specifi what the sampl ar in step . specifi how much vinegar in step . specifi the size of the contain in step . in step specifi how on should remov the sampl from the contain .
1591	1	3	3	the addit inform you would need in order to replic the experi would be first name the four differ sampl given to you . secondli you would need the amount of vinegar need to pour into the contain and what kind of contain . thirdli you would need to know how you would determin the mass exampl with an electr balanc . the student need to be more specif on their materi .
1592	1	1	1	addit inform i would need in order to replic the experi would be how much vinegar for each sampl a control group and a depend variabl .
1593	1	0	0	when the group said to place a sampl of on materi into the o then contain then repeat . it doe not make sens becaus peopl could repeat put the sampl into all the contain back to back . you don t have to wait hour for let the sampl sit in the contain .
1594	1	2	2	in order to copi thi experi you need to know what sampl to us for exampl list the marbl limeston wood and plastic . also state how much vinegar to pour or how littl same with the distil water . and what will you us to determin the mass of the sampl .
1595	1	1	2	addit inform need to replic thi experi can be a number of thi . on import thing would be how much vinegar ar you pour in the contain . without put the same amount it can chang the mass of the sampl . anoth thing is in step three the materi and what you ar cabl should be state . how ar you go to know what to label it as and what materi it is .
1596	1	1	1	why thei ar do thi experi what the problem is how much vinegar is need . what is the control for the experi
1597	1	0	0	what i would need it to mayb is to let the sampl sit and dry for more than minut p also multipli the last row for start mass end mass differ in mass . be thei repeat it .
1598	1	0	0	addit inform would consist of it shape resist and total mass loss to complet the experi .
1599	1	0	0	on piec of inform need to replic the experi would be materi start becaus it could or from the . anoth would be how mani of each sampl you ar put in the cup . and the last could be if there wa a control to the experi .
1600	1	1	1	the addit inform need in order to replic the experi is to have a control for each of the four differ sampl also measur the amount of vinegar be pour and hour exactli be wash .
1601	1	3	3	first thing i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each contain . anoth thing that mai or mai not be a determin factor in thi experi would be the each temperatur and the temperatur of the vinegar . lastli i would need to know which sampl increas becaus i could have differ sampl than them .
1602	1	2	2	on thing i would need is what the sampl were becaus sampl is over basic word and can mean anyth . also i would need to know what the contain look like so i know what kind of contain i should check for thi experi . last the procedur should add the constant for the experi so i know what not to chang .
1603	1	1	1	in thi procedur i would of also mention weigh the rock i would at state how much vinegar you pour in each contain and i would of list how to find the mass .
1604	1	1	1	some of the addit inform that will be need is how much vinegar will be pour in the contain also will need four contain a balanc bean to weight it and the sampl .
1605	1	0	0	the follow addit inform i would put is record the differ in mass after the begin and end of each mass .
1606	1	0	1	after read the group s procedur i would need to know what kind of sampl wa i suppos to got and how much i need to us for thi investig so i can replic the experi .
1607	1	2	2	the procedur left out some inform that is need . for step three it doesn t specifi what materi or what size contain to put the materi in . it should also tell you to do repeat trial .
1608	1	2	2	fix thi experi the procedur need addit inform . for exampl the four differ sampl or how mani or what kind of contain . then it need to state how much of each sampl . thi procedur need to be more descript and precis so peopl do the experi get it done correctli .
1609	1	1	1	in order to replic the experi you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the contain .
1610	1	0	0	mayb after the experi thi procedur should be done a second time to see the result come out the name react wai .
1611	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i d need to know what differ sampl i need i d also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each contain i d need to know what i d us in order to determin the mass .
1612	1	0	0	after i had finish read the inform i think i would need four type of vinegar but ident and four contain then i would need to determin the mass of each sampl .
1613	1	1	2	there ar three thing you would need to know to replic thi experi . you would need to know how much vinegar you need to add to each of the four contain . anoth thing you would need to know is if the four sampl all need to have the same initi weight or mass or size . lastli the procedur need to tell you how to record your data . also you need to know what thei ar compar their data to their control and constant .
1614	1	2	1	the addit inform i would need to know to replic thi experi would be how much vinegar in pour into the contain what wa in each differ sampl and why thei pick the sampl . i will also need to see the constant and independ and depend factor .
1615	1	2	2	thi group need to includ quantit inform such as how much vinegar . thi group should try to elimin the us of the word sampl it can be confus to someon which sampl thei ar talk about . i also think it would be better if possibl to us the same mass for all sampl thi will show the chang in proport to how much of the materi .
1616	1	0	0	the addit inform that you would need is the statement why were you do thi and were the result right or wrong . such as thi the type of result you were look for .
1617	1	3	3	you would have to know how much vinegar to put into the contain . you would also have to know what environ to put the cup in in the sun would caus differ effect than insid or in a shadi area . p lastli you would have to know what you put then to and leav them on a paper towel insid or on a tabl etc .
1618	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi i would need to know what type of sampl i should us in the experi . just sai sampl is not specif enough . i should have the exact type of materi . i also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to us in the experi . should i us a lot of vinegar or a littl ml amount of vinegar is need to replic the experi . i also need to know how to find the differ in mass . in procedur sai to determin the mass of each sampl but it doe not sai how to find the differ which is what will solv the problem in the experi .
1619	1	3	3	. how much vinegar how big a contain were the sampl complet cover p . what temperatur did the sampl sit at p . rins sampl how long or until what desir effect
1620	1	3	3	some addit inform you would need would be the name of the four sampl be us in the procedur the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cup be us . you would also need to be told to determin the differ in mass .
1621	1	3	3	i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup . i would also need to know if the sampl had to be anyth in particular . do you have to have the four sampl relat to each other or can thei be random item how long do i rins the sampl in distil water for
1622	1	1	1	the first bit of inform that you need is how vinegar is need in the four differ contain . thei never said what to us to determin the mass and thei never said what kind of sampl .
1623	1	3	3	to replic thi experi you will need to also includ what type of sampl to get . i could get ani thing i saw and it would fit the descript in the procedur . you also need to includ how big the contain should be and how much vinegar to put into them . you should also includ how to find the mass us what measur system .
1624	1	0	0	the student would also need to keep record everi thing thei see .
1625	1	1	1	st you need the sampl to be the same amount as everi other sampl then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all contain and try wast dai the dai to see what would happen .
1626	1	2	2	the procedur doe not state what the four sampl thei ar test . thei have to be clear and actual name them also . we do not know how much of each sampl to place in the contain . it should have a constant mass for each of the sampl . the procedur doe not state how much vinegar to pour in h o it is veri import to know the amount that thei put in .
1627	1	3	3	you also would need to know how much vinegar to us what kind of vinegar to us and the differ sampl .
1628	1	3	3	after read the group s procedur there is much addit inform that i would need in order to replic the experi . first off you would need to know what the sampl ar and what size of sampl you will test . anoth piec of inform that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you d pour in the contain step two . from step on and six you ar suppos to determin the mass of all four of the sampl that to do thi you would need to know what you ar take the mass in . ie gram pound coupl
1629	1	1	1	the thing that thei could ve includ would be that thei need a constant thei need to specifi how much vinegar is in each contain and also to includ the number of trial to do .
1630	1	3	3	to replic thi experi on would have to know what is meant by the word sampl in other word sampl of what on would would also have to know what type of contain each sampl be place in . should the sampl be place in a beaker graduat cylind or a crucibl or ani other laboratori contain on would also have to know for how long and how vigor each sampl should be wash after hour .
1631	1	2	2	to replic the group s experi other thing i would need to know ar p what sampl . p how much vinegar i need to pour . p how much of the sampl i need to pour into each contain .
1632	1	3	2	if i were to replic thi experi i would need to know how much of each sampl wa us . i would also need to know how much vinegar wa ad to the contain . also the size of the contain would be help . i might also need to know how much distil water to us when rins each materi .
1633	1	1	2	addit inform need would be the amount of vinegar pour into each contain . i would also need to know if the sampl much be a certain size
1634	1	3	3	addit inform i would need to know would includ sever thing . i would need to know what the four sampl of materi ar . i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each contain . i would lastli need to know what type or size my contain need to be .
1635	1	2	2	first you would need to know what sampl ar go in the cup . also we need to know how much vinegar we ar pour into the sampl . final to duplic thi experi you would need to know how much of the sampl goe in each cup .
1636	1	1	0	some addit inform that we would need in order to replic thi experi is observ of what the sampl look like befor dure and after the chemic reaction . also we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we ar just calcul the mass of the four and lastli you need to re check your calcul .
1637	1	2	2	in order to replic the experi we would need to know what differ sampl to us . thei show sampl in the data tabl but in the procedur it onli sai four differ sampl which can be mislead and confus . we would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each . lastli in order to replic the group s procedur we would need to have a control variabl that we could compar the result to .
1638	1	2	2	the group s procedur is miss a coupl of element . for on thei need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sampl secondli thei need to record the size of each sampl . thei need to determin how much rins water is need to wash all the sampl .
1639	1	1	1	in order to replic the procedur you need to know when other materi you will need what sampl you need .
1640	1	2	1	you will need to add in step where to remov the sampl . how to determin the mass of the sampl . what materi to us for the sampl . these were addit inform need in order to replic the experi .
1641	1	2	2	first you would name the four distant substanc sai the size of the contain also how much of each substanc in each contain should be specifi . overal thi experi need to be more specif and valid for thi lab to be repeat
1642	1	1	1	i would need to know what step ar test what the independ variabl is what size be sampl thei ar talk about . i would also need to know what other variabl ar control .
1643	1	2	2	to replic the experi the first thing that a group would need is a control variabl . second we would need to know where to put the sampl after take them out of their contain . in abl to complet thi experi . lastli we would need to know what kind of temperatur condit to put the sampl in . in abl to have the experi press .
1644	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the contain . we also would need to know how thei plan to measur the mass of each sampl . anoth thing we would need to know befor we could replic thi experi what the hypothesi is .
1645	1	1	1	the addit inform that would be need is a control which could be no water ad or more trial to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water wa us in the experi .
1646	1	1	1	in their procedur the student weren t veri clear on what the sampl were . if thei didn t have that tabl i wouldn t have known what their sampl were . thei also didn t list all the materi thei us for thi experi . so if i tri to repeat it i could onli guess the materi thei us . these student also weren t veri descript in the procedur . the wai thei word some of the step wa veri confus . thei need to make it clearer .
1647	1	3	3	the addit inform that i would need to replic thi experi is what size contain will be need what size of marbl limeston wood and plastic will be need also what kind of vinegar wa us if specifi .
1648	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi on would need to know some background inform on the properti of marbl limeston wood and plastic . specif their chemic makeup and the element contain in the sampl . a second piec of inform you would need to know is if there should be multipl trial . thirdli on would need to know the effect of acid rain on the sampl physic properti in order to determin a valid hypothesi conclus .
1649	1	2	2	the experiment procedur doe not specifi the amount of vinegar to be us the mass of the sampl to be us or the type of wood and plastic . the experi cannot be replic without thi inform becaus the scientist doe not know the amount and type of materi that the group of student us in their experi . it is imposs to know if the experi be perform is correct if the amount and type of materi ar not specifi .
1650	1	0	0	in order to replic the experi you would need to know about acid rain and the product you ar test how to calcul mass know how to compar the mass of the product befor and after the experi .
1651	1	1	1	after read the group procedur i would add what the four differ sampl were for step i would us a exampl like price marbl into on contain and label it made so other would be abl to make clearli see the step i took after step ca i would add determin the differ between the end mass and the start mass record the differ in mass other inform i would ar how to determin the mass and how much vinegar to pour .
1652	1	1	1	i would need to know the amount of vinegar that is be pour in the contain . with what am i go to measur the mass of each sampl . i think that i would also need to know the problem that is try to be solv specif what am i try to find out .
1653	1	0	0	in thi experi you will need to add more inform like in the produc like how did you set up the sampl to begin off with . also it never said that the sampl were in a contain and need to includ that in the begin . but it did look like a good experi to do and how thei pour vinegar on each sampl and let it sit onli the limeston chang the most and the other sampl stai almost the same in the start and end mass .
1654	1	2	2	if you were to replic the experi describ in the procedur you would also need to know some addit inform . you would need to know how much vinegar you were suppos to pour on each cup or thi could show the result . the procedur also doe not reveal what four type of sampl should be us in the experi . it is import that the procedur when talk about weigh the sampl sai to us the same scale for all the mass .
1655	1	2	2	to repeat thi experi you would have to know how much of each sampl to put in the contain . you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contain . anoth thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry becaus the result could chang depend on temperatur light exposur and other factor .
1656	1	0	0	determin the mass of four differ sampl .
1657	1	2	2	i would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four contain . i would also need to know where to leav the contain from temp also what should i remov the sampl with tong
1658	1	3	3	to replic thi procedur i ll need to know the size of the contain . i ll need to know the sampl and i ll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each contain . the amount of vinegar and the size of the contain could be import variabl if thei ar not the same for each sampl .
1659	1	3	3	the addit inform i need in order to replic the experi is the amount of vinegar i pour in each of the contain how big or small the contain have to be and whether or not i should close the contain .
1660	1	3	3	you would need to know the amount of vinegar pour in each separ contain also you would need to know what the sampl is and if you should put the contain in a veri dark or sunni place for hour .
1661	1	3	3	in order to replic the experi i would need to know the amount of vinegar thei us in each contain the type of contain what thei mean by a four differ sampl if not given data tabl as well as the form of the rock liquid crush whole etc .
1662	1	2	2	three addit piec of inform i would need to be abl to replic the experi is first how much vinegar do you place in each contain what ar the sampl you should us and third what is the control to show that vinegar is what chang the mass those ar the three thing i would need to know so that i can replic the acid rain experi .
1663	1	0	0	i think thei would need safeti goggl and glove to be safe . thei could of extend the time . so instead of be for hour it can be hour for best result . i would actual give the sampl hour to dry becaus there is water in the sampl and it need to evapor .
1664	1	3	3	in order to replic the acid rain experi it is essenti to know what the sampl ar . in the step it sai to determin the mass of four sampl . what ar the sampl also how ar we suppos to find the mass of the sampl in step it sai pour vinegar in each four separ but ident contain . what is the size of the contain and what type of vinegar is us also in the th step it sai to rins each sampl with distil water . for long should the sampl be rins
1665	1	2	2	in order to replic thi experi more inform is need . it would be import to know how much vinegar into each contain . it would also be us to know about what size the contain should be . final to be sure the experi is replic exactli it would be import to know what type of wood sampl wa us as differ wood have differ properti .
1666	1	2	2	you would need to know what to make the four sampl out of how much vinegar to add . how much sampl to add into each solut . in order to replic thi experi .
1667	1	2	2	on piec of inform you would need to replic thi experi would be the measur for the vinegar . how much should you have in each contain anoth bit of inform not includ is how you ar measur the mass and how much at each sampl should be us in each contain for exampl in in marbl squar .
1668	1	3	3	the addit inform you would need to know from the group procedur to replic the experi is the type of sampl how much vinegar in each contain and what s the size of materi that you put in the vinegar .
1669	1	0	0	number pour vinegar in each of the four separ not ident contain . thi can help determin the mass of each item and help with the experi from what we read after place sampl into the contain then let it sit will determin the mass .
1670	1	0	0	to determin the mass of four differ sampl to pour vinegar in four separ contain . place a sampl of on materi into on contain and label . after hour remov the sampl from the contain allow the sampl to sit and dry for min and final determin the mass of each sampl .
1671	1	1	1	we would need to replic step for sampl . p marbl limeston wood plastic . p what kind of contain p if the contain ar dry it can chang the differ in the mass .
1672	1	1	1	in order to replic thi experi we would need to know the temperatur of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in . both of these could vari and therefor chang the result of the experi .
2788	2	1	1	chang the type of grain would improv the student s experi give a better new at those data . p give the name of each type of plastic type us in thi experi . each plastic should be the same length . p my conclus is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the differ type .
2789	2	3	3	conclud from the student data that plastic type b wa the stretchiest while type a is the least stretchi . two wai that the student could have improv their experi is to have describ how much height to us . anoth wai that thei could have gotten more valid result is clarifi how much plastic to us hang of the tabl .
2790	2	1	1	two wai that the student could ve improv the experi is by get a more better brand of plastic or simpli redo the experi .
2791	2	1	1	a conclus i can make from thi experi is that plastic type b is the stretchabl becaus in trial on it stretch mm while in trial two it stretch mm without break . on wai the student can improv the design is by ad more weight . a second wai is to includ more trial so there is more to compar to .
2792	2	3	3	a . on conclus i can draw is that plastic b stretch the most than there wa plastic d the next plastic c and final plastic a . b . thei could have us more trial . two trial is not enough to have a valid experi . next thei could have said how long each plastic had to be . if there is more or less on on plastic then there could be more polym make the experi invalid .
2793	2	2	3	my conclus to thi experi is that plastic sampl b stretch the most becaus it wa probabl a sampl stretch easili . p b two thing that could be chang is sai what kind of plastic it wa and sai hope much weight is put on each clamp .
2794	2	1	1	you can conclud that plastic b wa the most valuabl and wa abl to stretch the most while plastic a wa the most rigid and least stretchabl . two wai the experi could have improv wa to also test for longer amount of time to see if time wa a factor . us differ wight for differ trial could also give out more benefici data .
2795	2	2	1	by look at the result on can see that plastic type b and d stretch almost twice as much as the other two type . thi show us that b and d ar most like low densiti polym becaus of their flexibl . a and c howev ar not as flexibl and therefor ar high densiti polym . the experi could have been improv by ad anoth plastic type or run more trial . the weight could have been chang also to test the strength .
2796	2	2	2	materi type a stretch the least and materi type b stretch the most . materi type b stretch about mm more than a . a few wai the student could have the experi is be could have gotten differ length plastic to test it differ wai . also he could have ad more trial and averag them togeth to get more accur result .
2797	2	3	3	a a conclus about thi data is that plastic type a b stretch longer the second trial and that type c stretch longer the first and d stai the same . you can also conclud that plastic b ha greatest stretchabl . b two wai the student could have improv the experiment ar sign is that thei could have done more trial to increas valid . thei also could have us the same length of differ plastic each time .
2798	2	3	3	a . plastic type b is proven to be the most stretchabl materi becaus it ha stretch to the greatest length which wa mm and mm . b . wai to improv the experi is there should be trial and the size of each materi befor be stretch should be held constant .
2799	2	1	2	a base on the student s data i can draw the conclus that plastic type a is the most durabl becaus it stretch the least an averag of mm while plastic type d is the least durabl . p b to improv thi experi the student s could have ad a control and specifi how much weight should be ad to the clamp .
2800	2	3	2	base on the student s data plastic b stretch more . b the student could have improv the experi by rest the plastic at the same length also by do more than just two trial us sam . put same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag .
2801	2	3	3	a the student conclud that plastic b wa the most flexibl stretch up to mm on the second trial and mm on the first . b the student could have improv thi design and valid of hi lab in two wai . first he could have done the experi a third time to further confirm result . second the student could have been more descript in hi procedur explain how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actual add .
2802	2	1	2	base on the student data it look like all type of plastic stretch at least mm . the most amount stretch wa mm for plastic type b then mm for d mm for c and mm for a . p to make the experi more valid the student could perform more trial mayb us a differ type of clamp or other weight to test the plastic s flexibl .
2803	2	3	3	a conclus that can be drawn from the student data is that plastic b ha the most stretchabl . two wai thi student could have impos the experiment design and or valid of the result is . the student could have said what the initi length of the plastic wa and keep all the other plastic at the same length becaus if on plastic wa longer than the other the experi would be valid . and thei also sai how much the weight that were be us weigh becaus on could be heavier than the other .
2804	2	2	2	a conclus that can be made base on thi experi is plastic type d stretch the most plastic type d stretch the second most plastic c the third most and plastic a the least most . the student could have improv the valid of the experi by includ anoth trial . also includ what size or how heavi of a weight to us for in the experi .
2805	2	0	0	a . base on thi student s data i conclud that trial wa more effect . p b . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is give the name of the plastic thei us .
2806	2	1	1	a in conclus plastic type a is the strongest plastic and plastic type d is the weakest plastic becaus it stretch the most . p b the student should have made sure all the plastic length were equal . the experiment should have also test them all at the same time to get accur data .
2807	2	3	3	as shown in the data tabl i can conclud that plastic type b wa abl to stretch the most in the minut . the tabl also show that plastic type a stretch the least conclud it wa veri strong or had less polym . two wai the student can improv their experiment design would be to make sure that all the plastic sampl were the same length . anoth wai the student can improv the experi would be to includ the weight so an independ variabl can be clearli state seen .
2808	2	1	1	a . base on the student data i can conclud that t overal had better result that t for t a b and c were all longer than t . p b . the student could have improv the experiment design and for valid of the result by specifi the amount of weight that wa ad to the clamp and the student should also have specifi the plastic that were us to make a more valid point . p a . p b . p c . p d .
2809	2	0	0	the second trail the first two number ar higher then the two in the first trail . on number lower than the first time and the number the same on wai the could improv there experi is thei could of made a graph with there result .
2810	2	1	2	the question in thi experi is how mani weight did it take take for the plastic to indic while measur . the conclus wa that t wa more of a success . on wai the student could have improv wa explain how heavi each weight wa and how best you should add each weight to the clamp . anoth wai thei could ve improv wa us the exact type of plastic with the same measur .
2811	2	3	3	a plastic type b is made of the stretchiest materi . b it doe not sai how mani or how heavi the weight ad ar caus the result to be inaccur . also the length is not the same for ani trial or type of plastic .
2812	2	1	1	plastic type b contain the most elast . the could have explain wa some of the differ procedur were us for and to be more clear on explain the procedur becaus when you explain a procedur you want to explain it in a wai that ani on can prefer in it .
2813	2	1	0	in conclus base on the student data collect plastic type b wa the farthest stretch . on wai to improv the valid of their design to have differ size of the plastic sampl us . anoth wai to increas the valid is to get wide rang of the differ type of plastic .
2814	2	3	3	a the plastic type b ha the greatest stretchabl out of the other type . p b the student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensur that onli independ variabl is the type of plastic . also the student must determin the weight of the weight clamp on the plastic to keep on independ variabl plastic type . it is import to keep your constant constant .
2815	2	2	2	base on the student s data it look like thei want to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch . plastic type d must be hard plastic becaus for both trial on and two the plastic did not move mm . the student could have improv their result by tell us how much weight thei us . without the amount of weight no on know how much to us so our result will be differ . also in step the student did not sai how long the plastic must be cut .
2816	2	1	1	i conclud base on the data that out of the four differ polym plastic plastic type b wa abl to stretch the most mm mm . other plastic type such as a onli stretch mm plastic type c onli stretch mm and plastic type b onli stretch mm .
2817	2	3	3	a base on the data i can conclud that plastic b had the most stretchabl it stretch and mm . c and mm and d mm were in between . p b . on wai the student could have improv their experi design is to clarifi everyth . what plastic how long ar thei etc . thei could improv their valid by do three trial instead of two .
2818	2	1	1	plastic type a seem to have been stretchi becaus it wa stretch mm while b and c onli stretch mm . and type d is not stretchi becaus the number stai at mm . the student could have us someth heavi do with tape to hold it on the tabl in eas it came off and thei could have also us someth better than a clamp to stretch it .
2819	2	2	2	a . my conclus is that base on the data plastic b ha the most stretchabl . p b . the student could have improv the experi by do a third trial and if need a fourth . the student could also have repeat the process to find out why t data is differ from t data .
2820	2	3	3	plastic type b is the most stretchabl plastic out of the reach mm . to improv thi experi the person do the lab need to know the weight of the weight along with the clamp that is serv as anoth weight .
2821	2	3	3	in conclus the polym with the most stretchabl is polym b in t and t polym b had the highest number of mm out of the other polym . there for it stretch the greatest amount . in the futur i think it would be help for the student to record how much weight thei us to test each polym . i also think it would be benefici to test more trial to be confid in the result .
2822	2	2	2	a plastic type b is more stretchabl than plastic type a c or d becaus in trial plastic b stretch mm and it stretch mm . in both trial plastic type b stretch farther than the rest . a the student could improv the experiment design by be specif with what polym she wa us the student could improv valid of her result by conclud even more trial than just .
2823	2	2	2	a i conclud that plastic type b is the plastic with the best stretchabl . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi is by do more than two trial for each type of plastic . anoth wai the experi could be improv is by do trial with differ amount of weight .
2824	2	0	0	in conclus some would stretch a lot and same wouldn t . thei could improv it by ad more clamp or by stretch it more .
2825	2	2	3	a in both trial plastic type b stretch the most . it stretch mm in trial on and mm in trial on . p on wai the student could have improv their experi is have all the plastic the same length . anoth thing could thei could have done to put on the weight till it repeat .
2826	2	0	0	some of the student do like measur but also like us the data tabl to find out the stretch amount is in the chart .
2827	2	2	2	on of the mani conclus that can be drawn from thi piec of data is that plastic d stretch the most and plastic a stretch the low . two wai to improv thi experi is on to add more trial and two describ the amount of weigh be ad to the clamp . thu piec of info is crucial .
2828	2	0	0	the two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar why thei put letter under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not a or b . my second wai to improv the experiment design is the amount stretch mm is wrong becaus what is t and t where is the t if their three type of plastic .
2829	2	2	2	a plastic type b is the stretchabl plastic than type a c and d . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi is to make sure that each piec of tape is the same length becaus it mai affect the stretchabl of the plastic . anoth wai to improv the experi is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type becaus it mai affect the amount stretch .
2830	2	1	1	plastic type b is the polym with the most stretchabl . at the end of the experi thi is appar becaus in both trial it stretch the most mm . two wai to make the experi better would be to leav the weight on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on anoth wa would be to make the experi better would be to leav the height on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on . anoth wai would be to us a doubl thick of each materi in evert trial .
2831	2	1	1	the conclus that i draw base on the student s data is that plastic a stretch the most . two wai that the student could have improv their experiment design and or valid of their result would be to test all the materi at least three time and to and to allow the weight to hang longer than five minut . test all materi three time improv the student valid becaus it becom more accur . allow weight to hang longer make it easier to see which materi stretch the most .
2832	2	1	0	a after review of the result on can conclud that plastic type b as the most stretchabl and durabl thi is becaus it had the highest mm stretch distanc for both trial . p b the student could have improv the result valid by perform more trial after minut . by give the plastic time to recov he can either test the durabl over time .
2833	2	2	2	base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most with and where as plastic type a stretch and . p on wai thei could improv is as by make the size of the plastic constant . anoth wai thing could improv it is by make sure that when your let it hang to stop it at exactli minut as you can keep the time constant too .
2834	2	0	0	the student conclus of thi trial would be plastic type produc mm of stretch for t and t produc mm so it increas by mm . type b produc mm of stretchabl for t and mm for t for an increas of mm . type produc mm of stretch abil for t and mm for t decreas by mm . and lastli type d produc mm of stretchabl for t and mm for t . that s what a student conclus would look like .
2835	2	1	1	a base on the data it possibl that he s hypothesi wa right becaus the data seam close to each other so there s a higher possibl right than wrong . p the could have made more trial includ a control variabl on that doesn t chang anoth wai as by ad more weight but do the procedur a littl bat differ .
2836	2	2	1	i have conclud that plastic b is the stretchiest and plastic a is the least stretchiest . a valid issu could have been leav the weight on to long . anoth valid issu could have been the measur of the plastic wa off .
2837	2	1	2	a plastic type b stretch the most after five minut stretch mm in trial and mm in trial . the plastic type that stretch the least wa type a . it stretch mm in trial and mm in trial . in conclus the strongest polym is type b . p b the first wai the student could improv on the experi in a whole is tell what type of plastic were each . he also could tell how much weight wa ad dure the trial .
2838	2	2	2	a . the plastic type b could stretch the longest at and mm . also the plastic type d is the onli plastic that had the same length of mm for both trial . p b . make a control have the clamp without weight be measur . also thei could ve repeat the experi by daili on more trial .
2839	2	1	1	a base on the student data i can conclud that the amount each plastic type stretch at consist rate dure both trial . p b the student could have improv the experiment design by specifi how much weight wa be ad to the plastic sampl . thei could ve the valid of the experi by try differ amount of weight with each plastic sampl .
2840	2	2	2	a . base on the result i can conclud that plastic b stretch the farthest . in trial on and it beat all other by at least a margin of two millimet . b . on improv thei could ve made is to ani sai length of each piec and make sure thei were all equal . anoth improv could ve been to tell us the type of plastic for re creatur of the experi .
2841	2	2	2	a conclus base on the data is plastic type b is the longest stretch plastic us . two wai thei could have improv their experiment design valid of their result by hang the plastic sampl in a differ place and by cut all the plastic sampl the same length becaus that wa not state in the procedur .
2842	2	1	1	i conclud that plastic a and c ar a littl stronger plastic than b and d becaus the both a and c stretch less than b and d . p mayb wai to improv thi is mayb wait a littl longer until record restart becaus you might get a more interest result . anoth wai to improv the valid of the answer to mayb test anoth time will get a third result make the answer more valid and present .
2843	2	0	0	a a conclus that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic type c for t pool more than t and for plastic tyre d t and t had the same amount of stretch mm . p b thei could have test their experi out longer and thei could have us more interest materi .
2844	2	1	1	a plastic a b stretch down the same . plastic c wa not that stretch down at all . b . two wai the student could have improv their experi would be to measur the plastic type befor stretch down . thei should have had test the plastic in differ time . for exampl . t in minut t in minut trial minut etc until minut .
2845	2	1	1	plastic type b d ar more stretchabl than a c . p thei could do more trial and add more weight .
2846	2	2	2	a . base on the student data plastic type b stretch the farthest and therefor ha the most stretchabl . the on with the least stretchabl wa plastic type a . b . on wai the valid of the result could have done more trial . anoth wai the test could have been improv is by stretch the plastic by hand until thei break .
2847	2	1	1	if the student test out the four differ plastic stretchabl then add weight to the clamp on the bottom of the plastic and wait minut thei will come to the conclus that plastic that plastic b is the most stretchabl plastic b s result the first time wa the second time . the second most stretchabl is plastic d which wa then . so in close the student found if thei put weight on the differ type of plastic and wait minut then repeat that plastic b is the most stretchabl .
2848	2	2	2	a base on the student s data i can conclud that the plastic type a stretch the least with mm and mm . plastic type b stretch the most with mm and mm . p b on wai that the student could ve improv the valid is to add more trial . have at least trial would have made thi experi more valid . also ad more time interv instead of just on for five minut would have improv thi experi .
2849	2	3	3	a . base on the student s result it can be conclud that plastic b is the most stretchabl becaus it stretch an averag of . mm in minut . plastic a is the least stretchabl becaus it stretch onli mm in minut on averag . p b . . the student should have specifi the amount of weight ad to the clamp and possibl perform more trial at differ weight . . the student should have perform a third trial to obtain more consist and depend result .
2850	2	0	0	on for in cold wont up on down on c the investig be not be what a and b be . p a d in not good two d on t go up or down so c and d is not good for the investig .
2851	2	1	1	a my conclus from thi experi is that plastic type a is flexibl . b is somewhat flexibl c as well and type d isn t flexibl at all . p b the student could improv by be more detail in thing like the weight of the clamp itself includ a control of each plastic .
2852	2	3	3	the conclus of thi lab accord to the student data type b of the plastic is the weakest and type a of the plastic is the strongest . for the plastic c and d thei ar in between and c is close to a . the student could have improv the experi by sai the measur of the plastic and how much mass the wa on earth peac of plastic . anoth wai to improv the experi is make sure the temperatur is kept constant and that no on touch the plastic .
2853	2	3	3	the experi wa veri precis and contain multipl trial that prove to be similar to the previou on . plastic type b appear to have stretch the farthest but it is imposs to tell see there ar no start length . the plastic as well as the weight should have been the exact same size .
2854	2	2	3	a . base on thi student data i can come to a conclus that plastic type b wa the most stretch . p b . two wai the student could have improv is by record the length of the plastic befor stretch . also the student should have test it three time instead of two .
2855	2	0	0	the tabl characterist properti we formul in the tabl becaus and amount stretch mm t total is and t the total at oh clamp to the bottom plastic sampl .
2856	2	2	2	in thi experi i can conclud that plastic type b wa the plastic that wa capabl stretch the most . i can tell that plastic type a wa the least abl to stretch the most compar to other on . student can improv the design by have a control so that thei could compar result and make experi reliabl . also in the procedur thei should tell you how long the plastic should measur how long the length should be .
2857	2	3	3	a plastic type polym b had the best stretchabl out of the other polym plastic . the data show that in b s both trial it stretch and mm farthest than ani other plastic . p b two wai to improv the design ar by do more trial to be more accur and by state the amount of weight put on each bag the same amount of weight .
2858	2	2	2	accord to the data tabl plastic type b is the plastic that stretch the most without rip . on wai that the student could improv is in the procedur when it sai add weight she should tell how heavi should the weight be . also she should tell what plastic were us .
2859	2	3	3	a . base on the data on the tabl i can conclud that plastic b wa the stretchiest follow by plastic d c then a . hi result also seem precis becaus he did two trial and thei were total close to each other everi time . p b . in the procedur the student should have made each plastic sampl the same size keep it a constant variabl . thei also should explain how much weight to put on the clamp as it wa omit in the procedur .
2860	2	2	2	a base on the data plastic type b is abl to stretch out the best compar to all other the differ plastic type . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi would be increas the amount of trial . p anoth wai to improv the experi would be to increas the amount of minut it s left hang . for exampl from minut to minut .
2861	2	2	2	the conclus can be made that the plastic type b ha the greatest stretchabl becaus in both trial is stretch the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other plastic type . the student should have conduct at least more trial to valid the experi sinc trial ar necessari . for a valid experi would impact the stretchabl more test and constant would make the result more reliabl .
2862	2	2	2	a you can see the trail were accur to each other plastic b stretch the least with the averag mm . p b the student could have improv the experi by includ the region measur of the plastic . thei could have made the result more valid by keep the weight on longer so there would be more variat between each result .
2863	2	2	2	thi investig show that plastic b stretch the most but or ar the plastic us in thi experi . p on wai the investig could be to add more trial second if thei ad more time then mayb the outcom would have chang .
2864	2	1	1	i can conclud that in trial had a small impact on trial . the student could of improv ad the at same amount of weight to both type of plastic and keep that weight longer .
2865	2	1	1	a . plastic b c ar almost similar but plastic d stretch the most . p b . two wai thei can improv experi wa by ad a rd trial and also ad differ time .
2866	2	2	2	thei could of improv it by put their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tri the object more than time .
2867	2	1	1	plastic type c stretch the most in both of it trial and plastic type a stretch the least in both of the trial . the student could have allow the plastic to long longer than minut in case it take some plastic longer to stretch . the student also could have us plastic that all had the same length to begin with to elimin all chanc of error .
2868	2	2	2	plastic type a and b increas on the second trial while plastic type c decreas by mm and plastic type d stai the same mm both trial . p the student could have improv the design by conduct anoth trial to get accur result . the student could have been specif on the weight of the weight . for exampl add pound weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minut .
2869	2	0	0	the student could do better by describ it more how she did it and what she did add subtract multipli divid or someth .
2870	2	1	1	a base off the inform given plastic type b stretch the most the type d type c type a . p b . place more weight let it hang longer or less .
2871	2	1	2	plastic d didn t chang and plastic a stretch more in trial . basic most of the plastic chang but not all of them . p on wai is make each plastic the same length befor the experi . a second wai is us the same amount of tape for each plastic type .
2872	2	1	0	accord to the student s data the plastic that stretch the most wa plastic type d and the on that stretch the least wa plastic type a . p i think that thi experi could have been improv by instead of have a second trial you should have ad more time .
2873	2	2	2	from the data given to me i can draw the conclus that plastic type a is the least stretchabl of the plastic probabl becaus of it s tight bond . plastic d on the other hand is the most stretchabl of the polym loos bond . on wai the student could have improv hi result could have been a rd trial that would improv the valid . a second wai to improv the valid of thi experi would be to ensur on self to have the same length plastic and time the experi .
2874	2	3	3	a plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic . in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . the least stretch plastic wa type a . in t a stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . type d wa second stretchiest and type c wa behind d . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design valid of the experi is have a specif size of the origin piec of plastic to stretch and have a specif weight of the weight stretch the plastic . constant keep the result of experi valid .
2875	2	1	1	on conclus i made is that everi time in trial it goe farther than in trial the number increas . two wai the student have improv on their experi is by is by be more specif in their procedur and by ad a trial .
2876	2	1	1	. at the end of the experi i have conclud that plastic b had the best stretchabl becaus in and it reach mm the first time and mm the second time . my hypothesi wa also wrong becaus i had predict plastic a would have the most stretchabl but it didn t . p b . put someth heavier then weight . attach someth other then a clamp .
2877	2	1	1	a my conclus base on the student s data is that t a b held a stronger than for t c for t wa the on more mm than t but both trial seem out for plastic type d . p b two wai those student could have improv is if thei kept the plastic the same size and shape . and if thei let hang for a min longer .
2878	2	2	2	a . out of all the plastic plastic a is the stretchiest . base on the data it stretch mm while the other stretch mm or mm . p b . to improv the experi the student could have us plastic that were all the same length to begin with . the student also should ve verifi the weight of the weight thei us and made all thei us the same weight throughout .
2879	2	2	2	a in conclus plastic b had the most stretchabl . p b on wai the student could have improv thi experi could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial each plastic . the second wai i would chang the experi would be to us a stop watch be veri presid about the time .
2880	2	1	1	a . the conclus i have drawn about the student data tabl is that plastic a and b where stretchabl . while c actual decreas in size and d did not stretch at all . p b . two wai that the student could improv thi experi is by name the differ plastic so you know your not look the same kind of plastic that then onc . also to add more trial becaus thei onli held two .
2881	2	3	3	plastic type b wa the most stretchabl polym . the student could have conduct more trail and tell us how much the weight weigh .
2882	2	2	2	base on the student s data you can conclud that plastic a stretch the most . on wai the student could have improv the experi could be to have all of the plastic be the same size at the start of the experi . anoth wai thei could improv the experi is to add a specif amount of weight in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic .
2883	2	2	2	a plastic type b is the stretchiest base on their data . p b it could have be improv by us plastic of the same length . he also could have taken differ length of the same plastic .
2884	2	2	2	plastic type a wa the stretchiest . the student could have improv the valid of the result by do more trial in the investig and by measur the plastic prior to the experi .
2885	2	3	3	a plastic b ha the most stretchabl . if you take the averag of the two trial plastic b . mm is higher then plastic a mm plastic c . mm and plastic d mm . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi is by give a specif amount of weight to add to each clamp . anoth improv would be to do third trial becaus thi could increas the valid .
2886	2	1	1	a . my conclus would be that the plastic type b would be better becaus it stretch more . p b . on wai the could have improv there experi design would have been leav on e of the plastic bag with the weight the whole time control type of plastic bag .
2887	2	1	1	two wai tat the student could have improv wa to let the weight hang there for a littl more time . also us the same length of plastic for each trial .
2888	2	2	2	a plastic type b is the on that ha the most length . p b the student could had put the plastic info equal piec and add the same amount of weight to the bag .
2889	2	3	3	a plastic type b stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar to specifi the start length of the plastic sampl and to specifi the amount of weight ad to each clamp .
2890	2	2	2	a . plastic type a is the most durabl plastic becaus in trial it onli stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm which wa the least amount of stretch . plastic type b is the most durabl type of plastic becaus in trial it stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm which wa the most amount of stretch . the student could have improv their experiment design by state how much weight thei us for each trial becaus nobodi know how much weight thei were us for each trial . secondli instead of ad weight to the clamp the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch .
2891	2	2	2	plastic sampl c seem to be the least stretchi plastic becaus after test it contract . p . keep plastic size constant for each experi . p . determin amount of weight ad to the plastic from the clamp .
2892	2	1	1	two wai thei could ve improv there experi would be that thei could ve let the weight hang on the plastic for a littl but longer and that thei should ve us differ type of bag . the conclus wa that plastic type b stretch the most out of all the other bag .
2893	2	0	0	mayb he us the clamp to attach it befor he add in the ag red into .
2894	2	2	2	base on the data on can conclud that polym b is the stretchiest and polym a is the least stretchi . on wai that the student could have improv the experi is by repeat the test with differ amount of weight that wai sever stretchabl of the bag could be test . also the student could have conduct more trial . the more trial there ar the lower to the rise of error or accid .
2895	2	1	1	the conclus is that in trial the student conduct it seem that in t the plastic stretch more than trial on . the student could chang the experi by tell you how much weight she put on each clamp . she could have taken awai the second trial .
2896	2	3	3	a my conclus is that plastic b wa the most stretchabl plastic . it stretch out between mm in the two trial . p b the student could have state how mani weight he she ad . he she also could have record the origin length of each of the plastic he she wa measur .
2897	2	2	2	in conclus plastic type b stretch the farthest with a measur of mm for that and a measur of mm for trial . p thei could have done more trial or let the clamp hang on the differ plastic for a longer amount of time .
2898	2	2	1	a the conclus is that on were smaller the anoth on larg and in the end thei both equal p b on wai to improv is experiment design is if thei chang the weight . anoth wai to improv thi experi if thei try more trail there go to be better .
2899	2	1	1	a conclus base on thi experi is plastic b wa the most stretch to mm then on the second trial a stretch mm . on the other hand plastic a c and d wa lower than and mm both time .
2900	2	1	1	out of all the four plastic type b stretch the most . on wai the student could have improv wa to mention that there ar four type of plastic rather than ar in step on . anoth wai the student could have improv wa to make hi her data tabl more clear and accur by ad a time attach column .
2901	2	2	2	a base on the data you can conclud that polym b had the most stretchabl becaus it stretch the most trial on mm and trial two mm . p b to innat the valid of the experi the student could have includ the amount of weight that wa ad to the clamp . thi wai it would be ad that the amount of weight wa kept constant . the student also could have record two addit trial with more weight ad .
2902	2	2	2	a . the averag amount stretch for plastic type b wa the most while the averag amount stretch for plastic type a wa the least p b . the experi could have been improv by both . increas the number of trial for everi time the lab is conduct . increas the number of time the lab is conduct .
2903	2	2	2	a in conclus plastic type b is stretchier that the other plastic . type b stretch the farthest thant the other in that minut period . p b the student could have let the plastic be stretch until thei broke to see which on wa realli the stretchiest and should have ad the exact same weight for all the plastic type .
2904	2	2	3	base on the data receiv plastic type c ha stretch the most compar to the other plastic type c stretch mm for trial on and mm for trial two . in both trial on and two plastic type c stretch the most . p on wai thei student can improv the valid of their result is by ad a third trial . also you can measur each type of plastic to be the same exact size length and width . by do thi it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn t affect how much it stretch .
2905	2	3	3	a i conclud that plastic type b ha the highest amount of stretchabl . plastic b is abl to stretch from to mm . i can also conclud plastic a ha the lowest stretchabl at to mm . p b on wai to make the investig more valid is by have the length of each type of plastic be the same . also the student need to make sure the plastic wa tape the same wai with the same tape . the student also need to us the same tabl for all four plastic .
2906	2	0	0	to improv thi experi the student should have mention the differ type of plastic if mention it would give a more accur reason as why on type of plastic is more less stretchabl than the other . also what the differ plastic ar made off . if we know that it mai help us know why that plastic is or is not more stretchi from anoth type of plastic .
2907	2	1	1	a the plastic stretch about the same amount in trial and trial but the plastic amount of stretch differ greatli . p b the student could have done anoth trial or chang the experi up a littl bit .
2908	2	2	2	plastic b is stretchiest . p us a control and ran more than trial .
2909	2	2	2	a base on the student data trial had a greater amount of stretch remain the same number of min in both trial . b the student could have improv the experi by ad trial to ensur accuraci . anoth wai the student could have improv the valid of the experi wa to record the amount of weight ad to the clamp in step .
2910	2	1	1	a base on the data both trial have the same stretchabl . p b the student could have stretch both plastic at the sometim . also record how heavi the clamp ar .
2911	2	2	3	accord to the student s data plastic type b wa abl to stretch the longest with mm . type d wa close with mm but type c and a were for less stretchi with mm and mm respect . the student should have specifi how long the plastic sampl should be eat . the student should have also specifi how much weight wa ad to the clamp . for all i know he would have us random length and weight for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedur .
2912	2	3	3	base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most . howev the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of these result . first off their should be a requir standard length for each type of plastic the direct could be like . step cut a mm strip of each plastic . also thi experi should specifi the amount of weight place on the clamp and thi exact amount should be repeat throughout the rest of the experi .
2913	2	1	0	a from the tabl shown you can conclud that plastic type b in thi investig could stretch the farthest mean it is the strongest of all the effect type becaus it stretch mm and mm . p b could have said how much weight to start with each time put differ stress level on the plastic . told how long to keep the weight on befor ad on more becaus thi could caus a chang in strength or stretchabl .
2914	2	3	3	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic b stretch the most out of all the plastic . p b . two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by be specif about the length of each piec of plastic . anoth wai thei could have improv the experi is by repeat the experi .
2915	2	0	0	a the plastic did in fact stretch onli in to mm p b the student could have us more weight on the second trial or mayb on the second trial let it be longer .
2916	2	2	2	base on the student data we could see that plastic type b wa the polym that stretch the most for both trial thei had a longer length than all of the other of mm and mm . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design could have been to note on the graph how long the polym wa befor it wa stretch .
2917	2	1	1	the plastic type d is stretch the same amount in both trial . on thing thei could of improv on is thei should have have trial not just .
2918	2	3	3	a base on the data shown in the experi plastic b had the most stretchabl and plastic a had the least stretchabl . p b thei could have improv their experi by . start out with the amount of weight for each plastic and . thei could have perform on more trial to make sure their result were correct .
2919	2	1	1	if we stretch differ type of plastic then the second plastic plastic d would stretch the farthest . p two wai the student could improv the experiment design and for valid of the result ar name the plastic to know which on is which so the data will not get mix up . also do more than trial . anoth trial might help the data .
2920	2	0	0	well thei improv by make the right design and follow the right instruct .
2921	2	1	1	base on the result shown plastic b ha the highest stretchabl . after ad weight to the plastic for minut it show that plastic b stretch the most and mm . next in high stretchabl come d c then a . even though thi experi wa good there ar two wai to improv the experiment design . i think thei should have test how differ weight effect each type of plastic . i also believ that there should be a control group on with no weight to compar the result of ad the weight .
2922	2	3	3	a i think that the plastic type a wa the strongest becaus it stretch down the least . plastic type b wa least strongest becaus it went down the most . p b the student could includ more trial to add valid . the student could have also includ how much weight wa be ad to the plastic .
2923	2	2	3	you can came to a conclus that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl for trial on it got mm and for trial it got mm compar to the other that onli got in the teen but got mm both trial .
2924	2	3	2	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type a is the most durabl . p two wai the student could have improv thi experi would be to clarifi how much weight wa ad to each plastic and to measur the plastic befor he she stretch it .
2925	2	2	2	a . polym b ha a higher stretchabl cut that all the other plastic test . p b . the student can abl more trial to their experi . also thei can clariti what type of plastic tin be us .
2926	2	2	2	a . plastic type b wa the stretchiest while a stretch the least . p b . make sure the plastic were all the same length . p . measur the plastic dure the process of stretch .
2927	2	2	2	plastic a b stai stretch from the t and then stretch more in t . c went down so it probabl get shorter as you wear it out i guess . d stai the same . p thei should of ad the amount of weight the attach to each plastic . thei should of said how much the clamp weigh .
2928	2	3	3	a conclus made from the student data is that differ plastic length ar affect by weight in their own wai stai the same grow or shorten . the student could have been more specif by write down how long each plastic ha origin befor the the trial . thei also could have been more detail about how much weight thei were ad to the plastic .
2929	2	1	1	a in conclus plastic type b stretch the most . the data sai it stretch mm on trial on and mm on trial . p b on wai the student could chang the procedur is allow them to hang for min instead of minut . also thei could chang it up by chang the weight everi time .
2930	2	2	2	a base on the data shown on the tabl i would sai that plastic type b ha the most amount stretch . p b the first wai is would of present the result better and have more trail . second it sai allow them to hang fro five minut it should ve been minut minut doe noth .
2931	2	1	1	a . plastic a is stretch the digest throughout the experi while plastic d shove no chang b . p the student could have improv the valid by ad more trait becaus the plastic . would have stretch larger if there were more trial and also add constant becaus if more thing ar the same throughout the experi then the result would be more valid .
2932	2	1	1	accord to the data provid thi experi had roughli the same outcom in trial and trial . it s either on number higher or lower in trial . but there re two wai that thi experi could be improv . on explain what type of plastic ar be stretch . two sai how much weight is go to be ad to the clamp .
2933	2	1	1	a . plastic b stretch the most . plastic a wa the strongest out of all . p b . thei should have ad more weight to see which would have stretch the most and which would be stronger .
2934	2	2	1	base on the result of the experi we can conclud that plastic type b ha the greatest elast of the four plastic . on wai the student could have improv on their experi is to run a third test . ad anoth test should show thei would get result similar too the first two test .
2935	2	2	2	a conclud from the student data plastic type a is the strongest plastic c is the least strongest is the third and b is the least durabl . b the student could have improv thi experi is by do at least on more trial . thei could have made a cool and warmli the depend independ variabl to ran to thi experiment design ar vari .
2936	2	2	2	a in conclus the plastic type b stretch the most in both trial . it s the stretchiest . p b the student could of stretch it by two student hold both side and simpli pull with weight on it . thei could of repeat the procedur on more time . thei should of had a control grai .
2937	2	2	1	a a conclus that i have conclud from the data tabl is plastic type b and d were stretch the most leav type a and c be the most durabl type of plastic . p b two wai that the student could have improv there experi design or valid ar more trial for more accuraci . and more plastic type to experi with to actual find out which on is the most durabl .
2938	2	1	1	a my conclus base on the student data is that plastic type a is the on that stretch the most . p b two thing the student could of did to make hi experi better is on tell us how much the weight weigh and two tell us the plastic type of polym be us .
2939	2	2	2	i conclud that plastic type b would be the best plastic for stretchabl becaus in both trial plastic b is the on that stretch the farthest . in trial it stretch mm and trial it stretch mm . the student could have improv the valid by give specif measur for size of plastic so lure ar all equal . the student also could have sold to us the plastic when thei were all the same dai the ag that ar isn t older or weaver than anoth plastic .
2940	2	2	2	a base on the student data a good conclus to make is that plastic b wa the strongest . p b some wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be thei should of said how much the weight weigh . also thei could of done more trial to make the experi more valid . also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accur result .
2941	2	1	1	a i conclud that plastic b ha the highest tensil strength . b thei could have said how much weight to add . as well as add a differ amount of weight for the second trial prefer a higher amount .
2942	2	1	1	polym a is a more hard and less ma liabl plastic which would been it would be like a on plastic d is realli ma liabl and stretch so it would be a polit polym . thei could improv on the design . by mai be us more weight so thei get more stretch and see it limit and wai it stretch becaus so polym stretch in differ direct . thei would do on more trial to get more data and make it more valid .
2943	2	3	2	a . base on the student date i can conclud that plastic type b is the most flexibl at all the sampl . p b . to improv their experiment design the student could have ad more trial and also specifi how much weight to add .
2944	2	1	1	my conclus is that plastic type a ha the least stretchabl and plastic type b ha the most stretchabl compar to both trial . on wai to have improv the experi design would have been to add weight and let them hang foe ten minut for the second trial and perform more trial with longer time with weight on the plastic .
2945	2	2	2	the student could sai how much weight he us . also increas the weight in the second trial . thei should also perform the trial at least time to increas the valid of the result the student must also increas the time of hang process .
2946	2	3	3	the measur of everi plastic should be the same to start . secondli there should be a precis amount of weight be ad . my conclus is that type b stretch the most . it wa easili the longest .
2947	2	3	3	the student can conclud that polym plastic b is the most stretchabl becaus it ha the longest length in both trial . two wai thi experi could have been better is by sai how much weight to add to each plastic polym and second by repeat the experi more than twice .
2948	2	3	3	i conclud that plastic type b stretch the most . on wai the student could have improv the experi design and or valid of the result is to make sure all the plastic type start out at the same length . anoth wai is to have a certain amount of weight for all the plastic type trial .
2949	2	3	3	a no conclus can be drawn from thi experi becaus the length of the plastic befor the weight ar ad we not list . therefor you can no see which plastic stretch the farthest . p b two wa thei can improv the valid of thi experi ar . list the length of the plastic befor it stretch and . state how much the weight weigh and if thei all the same .
2950	2	3	3	a base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl . thi is becaus it wa stretch more than the other plastic after minut in both trial for exampl plastic b stretch mm in the first trial but plastic d the next most stretchabl onli stretch mm . the student could have improv the experi ad more trial . thi would make their experi more accur becaus thei will have more both to us their by . thei should have also tell how mani weight to add at a time so that thei and whoever els doe thi experi remain constant .
2951	2	2	2	base on the student s data the trial for each of the differ plastic were veri similar and show no signific chang in how much the plastic stretch . two wai to be more specif on exactli how much weight is to be ad to the clamp . also the student should includ how big each plastic sampl should be becaus if thei us four differ size sampl the result would be inaccur .
2952	2	2	2	plastic type b stream the further out of the other three what happen to plastic . when i get low to the ground . how much weight do thei put to the end of these plastic .
2953	2	2	2	a plastic type b ha the most stretchabl out of them all . type d ha the second most type c ha the third mast and type a ha the least . p b on wai the experiment design could be improv is by sai how much the weight weigh . also it would have been better if thei averag both trial togeth also .
2954	2	3	3	plastic type b can stretch the most without bear to . the student could have conduct more trial which could have improv the experiment design and valid . the student also should have specifi the weight of each weight and the clamp so if someon were to repeat the experi thei would known how much weight to add .
2955	2	1	1	a the percentag of the amount the plastic stretch wa a lot lower in the second trial than in the first . p b thei could have done more trial . thei could have us more polym plastic .
2956	2	1	1	plastic type b ha the most stretchabl after trial and .
2957	2	2	1	i drew a conclus base on the student data that plastic type b stretch out the most in mm for both trial on and trial turn . on wai the student could have improv their experiment design is that thei could ve inform us what type of plastic were be test like garbag bag freezer bag and sandwich bag . anoth wai the student could ve improv their experi by how mani weight did thei put in for each plastic bag thei stretch out .
2958	2	1	1	base on the student data you can conclud that plastic b is more durabl than the rest of the plastic test . also that plastic a wa the least durabl out of the plastic . on wai the student could improv their experi is if thei have at least trial instead of just . anoth thing the group could do to improv their experi is to identifi the independ and depend variabl in their procedur .
2959	2	2	2	a . my conclus to the polym investig is that plastic be is more like to stretch the longest in five minut . p b . thei experi could had been improv if thei ad more trial to show consist or chang in the experi . anoth wai to give a hypothesi to show if you predict wright or wrong .
2960	2	3	2	a base on the data given i can see that plastic a is the strongest polym and doesn t have much stretchabl . p b to valid her result i think the student should have put how long the plastic wa origin and how mani millimet long it wa after the weight to see the actual data for ourselv . the student could test the plastic a third time to improv her experi .
2961	2	1	1	a . to conclud polym plastic b ha the highest stretch in meter . p b . add differ weight . p see which is more durabl or stronger . p clamp each differ .
2962	2	3	3	a conclus that can be drawn is that plastic type b is the most flexibl plastic and can stretch the farthest . the student could have improv their experi by state how heavi the weight were that were attach to the clamp . right now on can onli guess what weight that wa . anoth wai the student could have improv their experi is by state the origin length of all the plastic cut them all to a certain length would improv the valid of the experi becaus it would show plastic b actual stretch the farthest and did not just show off chang .
2963	2	3	3	from the data given i conclud that plastic b had the most stretch abil and plastic a had the least . two wai thi experi could be improv is by us the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by state how mani he us .
2964	2	1	1	a two out of the four plastic type length increas . p b first the student should have more trial and allow the weight to hang more than five minut on to the clamp .
2965	2	2	2	in each trial both and the amount stretch increas steadili and end at the same amount . two wai the student s could have improv there experi wa by sai how much weight to put on the clamp . anoth wai to improv the experi wa to sai how far would thei have want the weight and clamp to be far down or far up .
2966	2	3	3	a plastic sampl b wa the stretchiest becaus it s greatest length wa mm . p b thei should have measur the length of the plastic befor thei stretch it so we can know how much it stretch . thei also should have run more than two trial so we can be absolut sure of their result .
2967	2	3	3	a . base on onli the data shown on can conclud that plastic the most stretchabl out of all the plastic test becaus it stretch the most dure the experi on can also assum that plastic type a ha the least stretchabl becaus it stretch the least dure the experi . on wai that the experiment design could have been improv is to have control the origin length of all the plastic and make them equal . anoth wai to have improv the experiment design is to have includ the exact weight that wa be appli to the plastic .
2968	2	0	0	a . some plastic ar more strictli or mayb some of them ar harder than the other brand . p b . thei could of put the time period a littl longer . also for t thei could of put more weight than t .
2969	2	3	3	a in conclus plastic type b ha stretch the most probabl not the most depend materi . the best plastic type would be a . plastic type a can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don t have to worri about it rip . p b these student should have conduct a third trial . it would have made for find a better averag of stretch on the plastic type . also explain how much weight wa stretch these plastic bag .
2970	2	1	1	the conclus that i have drawn is that plastic type d stretch the most which make it more durabl than the rest . two wai he could have improv wa by tell us how much weight wa ad and by tell us he averag out the three plastic sampl strict .
2971	2	1	1	a the total amount of t is greater than t . p b all length should be the same and everi step should be equal to the other .
2972	2	0	1	from the student data from conclud that type d is most stretch abl and that type a is the least stretchabl . thi lab couldn t been improv by sai to record the measur in step . also by take what until to measur with in step .
2973	2	1	1	the number ingress for t most of the time . p do anoth trial .
2974	2	3	3	a from the tabl result for the experi you can conclud that type b wa the most stretchabl out plastic and type a wa the strongest at hold togeth the polym and cross link made it strong . p b she could have improv the experi by allow more trial and make sure the plastic sampl were the same size and length .
2975	2	2	2	a the polym plastic with biggest stretchabl wa type b becaus it stretch over mm . b the student should have measur the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamp were still on . also the student should have us plastic of all the same length .
2976	2	2	2	a in conclus differ polym plastic do have differ stretch abil some polym such as b and d ar much more stretchabl than polym such as a and c . p b the student could have improv thi experi by specifi the amount of weight us and how far to let them hang . also the student should have specifi how to calcul the amount of polym stretch .
2977	2	2	2	a in conclus plastic type b in trial and trial stretch more then plastic type a c and d . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design or valid of the result ar thei could of test more time to get better result and thei could of let the weight stai in the bag a bit longer befor remov them .
2978	2	2	2	it ha been confirm accord to the data in the tabl that plastic type b can be stretch out the longest compar to plastic type a c and d . plastic type b reach length of mm which is the highest length measur in the tabl . two wai the student can improv there design or valid of their result is by collect more data and creat more trial to get a more accur result .
2979	2	2	2	base on the student s data plastic type d stretch the most for both trial so that would be the on to choos when look for the most stretchabl . the first wai the student could have improv the experi is by do a third trial . the second wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by make sure all the clamp and weight ar the same and ar hang for exactli the same amount of time .
2980	2	3	3	a when stretch plastic b seem to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic a seem strongest . p on wai is to have equal size plastic to start with . anoth wai is to sai exactli how much weight need to be ad to each
2981	2	3	3	the conclus that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type b . stretch the most which wa mm in t and mm in t . on wai the student could ve improv the experi is to add anoth trial . also by us the same weight to weight .
2982	2	2	2	a base on the student s data plastic type b wa more flexibl and suscept to stretch . plastic type a wa most like a harder or thicker type of plastic make it more difficult to stretch . p b to improv the experi and valid of the result the student could have run more than two trial so thei had more to compar . thei also could have includ record result in their procedur .
2983	2	2	2	my conclus will be that with the ad weight the plastic stretch . p to make thi trial more reliabl the student should have state how long and wide each plastic should be . the student should have also state how much weight should be ad to the plastic .
2984	2	3	3	a base on the student s data plastic b is the most stretchabl polym plastic and plastic a is the least stretchabl . p b on wai the student could improv their experi is to perform more than just two trial to ensur their data is valid . anoth wai thei could improv their experiment design is to specifi how it tape the plastic so as to make sure their ar all tape and pull the same wai .
2985	2	2	2	the student s data show that the plastic type ar stretchabl . two wai the student could have improv the experi is by write it first start length and for anoth improv thei could have on a third trial to rest if their experi is true .
2986	2	3	3	the plastic that the most stretchabl is plastic b probabl due to the fact that all of the polym link ar parallel to each other and it stretch an averag of mm . wai that thi could have been improv is have a rd trial and us the same length for each sheet or plastic .
2987	2	2	2	a . plastic type d wa abl to stretch farther so base on that result i conclud it wa abl to withstand more weight . p b two wai the student could of improv the valid of the result ar us the same size of plastic for all trial and type and add anoth trial to combin result .
2988	2	1	1	of the plastic stretch farther the second time did wors the second time and a did the same . p a third trial might help and explain what the if plastic were .
2989	2	3	3	plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . on wai that thi could have improv is if the student did anoth trial to make sure that their experi wa valid . anoth thing the student want to do is make sure thei have the same size of plastic to start with .
2990	2	2	2	is conclus plastic b stretch the most and plastic a stretch less . p the student could ve detest a rd time and state wa he wa try the ac omplizb
2991	2	3	3	a in thi experi the plastic b stretch the most becaus it went mm and a went mm and mm and d mm . b . thei could have improv there experi by do more trial and have the plastic of the same length .
2992	2	2	3	a a conclus would be that plastic type a could withstand the most weight with out be stretch the most . p the first thing thei could do to improv their experi would be to us a specif of weight and clamp . the second thing would be to increas the number of trial .
2993	2	0	1	base on the data collect from the experi you can conclud that plastic type d stretch the most . valid the student did two trial and their result from the second tool were veri similar to the first trial . on wai the student could of improv the experi is ad more weight to see if thei could of stretch further . anoth wai to improv the experi is by us more then on type of plastic .
2994	2	1	0	a . plastic d and plastic c ar not that good . the two type that increas type a and b . p b . thei should not have tape it to a tabl . there should have been peopl hold it from both side . also i think thei should have measur in inch .
2995	2	1	0	type a plastic stretch the most . p attach the plastic to the side of the tabl in a more effect wai and provid the name of the plastic rather than give them variabl .
2996	2	2	1	a conclus i can draw from the data is that plastic type a had stretch more in t than the rest the other were onli on mm apart while plastic type a had a differ of mm . on wai the student can improv their experi is by have the plastic the same length in the begin and the second wai is by ad how mani weight it took so the plastic would stretch .
2997	2	3	3	in conclus plastic type b stretch the most in both trial . p on wai the student could have improv the valid is to cut each plastic to the same length . anoth wai to improv the experi design is to specifi how much weight to add to the clamp .
2998	2	2	1	i would conclud that the plastic t to more stretch than t . it could be improv quit a few wai first off it wa never state how much wight is be ad or if it wa the same each time or the fact that .
2999	2	2	2	a . the most stretchabl polym wa polym d where it stretch mm both trial also make it the most reliabl as it s stretchabl didn t fluctuat . p b . on wai thei could ve improv the experi is by specifi what the weight of the weight ad to the clamp were and how mani to ensur that all polym were test the exact same wai . second thei could have a third or even fourth trial to their experi to increas valid of the experi .
3000	2	0	0	the conclus would be that the plastic in trial wa stretchiest for the most part trial . two wai thei could have improv thi experi would be to repeat the procedur with differ plastic and put it at differ temperatur .
3001	2	3	3	plastic type a stretch the least out of all plastic lead to a conclus that it ha the worst stretchabl of all plastic . plastic type b stretch the most for both trail test enough info to conclud that b ha the best stretchabl . p the student could of improv their experi by ad in the procedur exactli what wa the weight of the weight thei us and thei could of perform a rd trail test to see if result were continu and never chang .
3002	2	3	3	in thi experi student test to see
3003	2	1	1	a accord to the data shown plastic type d ha the most stretchabl . p b the student could have done more trial made a line graph and test the plastic for differ time .
3004	2	1	1	base on the student data the amount that ha been stretch final didn t make a differ becaus so when up by and and some just shod the same . on wai the student could have improv their experi design is tell us how mani weight to add to the clamp .
3005	2	1	1	after read the data i have conclud that plastic type b is the stretch . on out of four type . i conclud that type b is the best becaus when you add up the number from t t for each number type b ha mm . so it is the longest on .
3006	2	1	1	a . the plastic that stretch the greatest ha the plastic type b . almost more than half the plastic type had stretch more the second trial . p b . thi student should label the name of the plastic not just a d .
3007	2	3	3	the conclus that can be drawn base on their data is that that plastic type a wa the least stretchabl and is the most durabl and plastic type b is the most stretchabl and the least durabl . on wai thei could ve improv their experi is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piec becaus that could affect the stretchabl of each plastic . anoth improv could be that thei could ve specifi how much plastic should be hang from the tabl so each plastic ha same amount of length .
3008	2	3	3	a . in conclus plastic b wa the best becaus it had the highest amount stretch for both trial in the first it stretch while a c d the second trial that it went up a mm to while a c d . p on wai thei could improv the valid is more trial your experi will onli get more valid with more trial . the second wai is to be more specif with what trial with what kind of tape how much tape your us and were you measur from weather it s the whole thing or just the part hang .
3009	2	2	2	a in conclus my hypothesi wa right . the plastic end up rip due to the fact that the weight wa hang on it . the independ variabl wa the plastic and the depend variabl wa the weight . p b the student could have improv the experiment design by have the weight the same for everi trial . also there should have been more than two trial .
3010	2	1	1	i conclud that plastic type d wa abl to stretch the most out of all of the plastic . the two thing these student would have done to improv the valid and experiment design is thei could have us more trial and thei also could have us a control
3011	2	0	0	plastic type a wa the strongest . the student could have made it befor and after instead of trial and trial . thei also could have name the differ type of plastic .
3012	2	1	2	a conclus that can be drawn from the student polym investig would be that plastic type a wa the strongest plastic us . it took the least amount of stretch although it had gain two stretch on the second trial . two wai the student could have improv their experi ar that thei could have increas the amount of plastic type and includ more trial of test the differ plastic .
3013	2	3	3	the data provid conclud that plastic type b stretch the most . on wai the student could improv the valid of thi experi would be to state the weight of the weight that ar to be ad onto the piec of plastic . on thing the student also should have done wa to have record the origin length of the plastic sampl so you could see just how much the piec of plastic stretch from their origin length .
3014	2	2	2	in conclus the student data tabl is base on that plastic type b in both trail had most stretch . the student could have improv more if thei add other trail and ad on control .
3015	2	0	0	for on the student could of us two height instead of on . and also us a differ method for exampl instead of hang the bowl from the tabl hang them up from a high place .
3016	2	1	1	plastic d ha no stretchabl . it stai the same both trial kind . p the student could of improv there experi by put a time for trial . also give an exact amount of weight that should be ad to the plastic .
3017	2	3	3	base on the student data plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl at mm stretch while plastic type a would be the worst at onli mm stretch . p two wai the student could have improv their data ar on thei could sai how heavi the weight were and mayb allow them to hang on the clamp for more than minut . two thei could have had more than trial .
3018	2	2	2	base on the student s data i can tell that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl . i see thi becaus in hi result plastic b had the greatest amount in millimet stretch . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of the result wa by give the initi length of the plastic and each plastic should have had a constant length .
3019	2	0	0	conclus the tape ha stretch more becaus of the weight level ha a high level of densiti . to improv thei should make a bar graph .
3020	2	1	1	a a conclus base on the student s data that i can draw is the plastic all stai around . the same amount stretch from t to t if ani thing it wa mm or mm of the first ti . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi design or valid of the result wa to do more than on wai to stretch the bag and to do trail each .
3021	2	0	1	to conclud plastic type b stretch more in trial . it stretch mm the plastic that least stretch wa plastic type a . it onli stretch mm for trial and mm for trial . thi mean plastic b is the strongest and plastic a is the weakest also plastic d stai constant for trial and .
3022	2	3	3	a conclus base on the student s data is plastic type b is the most amount stretch and plastic type a wa the least amount stretch . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is be more inform on the size sampl you must take . also the amount of weight you add on .
3023	2	2	2	in conclus to the student s experi each plastic had stretch more or less the same amount of the first trial . plastic b wa the most stretchabl . an improv the student should have made wa make each piec of plastic the same length befor stretch . the student could have improv the valid by show the length of the plastic befor it wa stretch to measur exactli which plastic stretch more .
3024	2	0	0	the two wai the student could have improv experiment design out or valid of the result ar . procedur add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minut . if you do that you do to know plastic is strang and can carri a heavi thing . remov the weight and camp and measur the length of the plastic type . after you remov the weight and could how mani weight thei can earli stuff in the plastic .
3025	2	1	1	a conclus drawn is that the result were fulli accur and had littl chang dure the second trial . the student could have includ a diagram to give a better pictur of how the experi should look like and a good info and result have at least trial . so the student should have done anoth trial and drawn a diagram .
3026	2	3	3	base on the student s data plastic type b wa consist the stretchiest of all the plastic type us in the experi . on possibl valid issu is the descript of the weight ad to the clamp in each trial . the procedur doe not tell in how much weight must be appli and thu a person mai appli uneven amount of weight depend on the trial and plastic . thi would caus the experi to have the uniform of it data in the fact that the weight wa not constant . also the student could have improv the experiment design by ad more trial to the experi and in turn gain more data to make the result more accur .
3027	2	3	3	accord to the data tabl it look like the plastic type b wa stretch the most and plastic a wa stretch the best . b . on wai the experi could have improv is if thei said what the measur of the plastic wa befor the weight were on it . anoth thing is thei have said how much the weight wa that hung on the plastic .
3028	2	1	1	base on the data shown plastic type d seem to be the most durabl . the tabl show that it did not stretch . the student could have improv valid by do more trial and repeat the experi more than onc in case ani error wa made dure the first run through of the test .
3029	2	1	2	the student could have improv their design result by measur the weight of the clamp without the weight attach and thei could have done a third trial .
3030	2	2	2	a the conclus is that plastic type a stretch the least mm compar to the other plastic . plastic type b stretch the most . . p b two wai that the student could have improv hi experi wa to do at least three trial to get a more accur result . anoth wai could have been stretch the plastic for more than five minut to make the result more accur .
3031	2	1	1	a the data from thi investig show that the plastic stretch the furthest wa type b next wa type d then type c and final type a . the inform show thei did two trail to make sure thei have correct inform . p b on wai the student could have improv thi experi design wa to make step and to explain the procedur more . next i would sai to make a graph would be the best wai to further improv these result .
3032	2	2	2	a conclus base on the student s data would be that plastic d ha the most stretchabl . on wai the student could have improv the experi would have been to show the thing kept constant . for exampl how much weight were us and how long ha each piec of plastic . anoth wai the student could have improv would have been to includ a control to compar to . for instanc on plastic with no weight .
3033	2	2	2	i think that plastic type b is the best becaus it stretch the farthest in both trial . p thei should ve been more specif with which four type of plastic thei should have us and thei should have said exactli how mani weight to put on it .
3034	2	3	3	b . the student should us all sampl plastic of the same length so the strength and stretchabl can be determin . the student should have also done at least on more trial to elimin possibl experiment error . p a . from the experi plastic type b came to be the most stretchabl . plastic type d wa also veri stretchabl and the second stretchiest plastic type c came after b and after c came plastic type a . plastic a wa the strongest but plastic b wa the stretchiest .
3035	2	1	1	a . in conclus base on the student data t s plastic where a littl bit weaker the t s . p b on wai a student could have im prove the experi is by ad more length to the plastic . p anoth wai to improv the experi is by try more trial .
3036	2	3	3	base on the student s data plastic b stretch the most with and mm in their trial respect . howev the student cold ve record the start length and the differ in length as from thi data the reader doesn t know if these result ar compar . in the procedur the first step is measur the length but i don t see that data . anoth improv would be more trial .
3037	2	3	3	a the student conclus is that although plastic d wa the most accur plastic b stretch the most for both trial . p b the procedur doe not sai the amount what unit of weight wa ad . the plastic also must all be the same length .
3038	2	3	3	on conclus that can be base off the student s data is that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl out of all of the plastic test . on wai thi student can improv the experiment design is to add more trial to the experi . anoth wai is to set the length the plastic should be becaus have differ plastic length can caus experiment error .
3039	2	2	2	in conclus plastic b stretch the most mm and plastic a stretch the least mm . p on wai to help improv the experi is to have a constant which would be each plastic with out ani weight . anoth wai to help improv thi experi is to specifi how much weight should be ad to the clamp .
3040	2	3	3	a base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most . on the first trial plastic type b stretch mm while plastic c onli stretch mm . on the second trial plastic b stretch mm and the next close wa plastic type d which stretch mm . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi is to do more trial and when the student ar start the experi tell me how long the plastic is befor you start to stretch it .
3041	2	0	0	plastic type a stretch in and plastic type d it didn t stretch at all .
3042	2	0	0	the conclus i have come to base off of the student data is that the most durabl plastic strength base is . i know thi to be true becaus there is no length differ between t t .
3043	2	2	2	plastic type a stretch mm on the first trial and on the second . type b stretch mm on the first and on the second . type c stretch mm on the first trial and on the second . type d stretch mm on the first trial and the same amount on the second . i can conclud that type b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch mm on the first trail and mm on the second trail . two wai to improv is to add a trail and try differ amount of weight .
3044	2	2	2	a conclus for thi lab could be that plastic type b stretch the most becaus it is thin and that type a stretch the least becaus it is the thickest . a wai that the student could have improv is to name the differ plastic . also to sai how much weight to the clamp .
3045	2	1	1	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic type d is the strongest of them all for both trial and . i think thei could have explain it more so that i could have a better mental imag of it . i also think thei should have said how much weight thei ad the the clamp .
3046	2	2	2	a . base on the student data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much . most of the plastic end up stretch mm . for exampl plastic a went from stretch at mm mm on the other hand plastic c decreas mm and went from mm mm plastic d didn t stretch within both trial . p to improv their experi the student could have record how long the bag wa befor weight were place on them and thei could have also said how much did the wight have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretch constant .
3047	2	0	0	the conclus i get on thi student data is that all the plastic have been weigh and been measur . but as thei did the trial the data chang and for plastic type d it weight and length wa the same it mean that it wa hang up last and thei took it down too fast so it measur the same .
3048	2	3	3	a the conclus that i could base is that plastic type b in both trial had stretch the longest . p b two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design is by let us know how mani weight put in each cup . also the same length of each piec should be note as well .
3049	2	1	1	a my conclus on the student data tabl is that plastic d wa the strongest . it stretch up to mm in both trial . p b two wai the student could have improv wa to make a trial or test and to be abl to measur the abras of the plastic type .
3050	2	1	1	after experi which plastic wa more pliant the conclus wa made that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl in both trial a and trial b . two wai the student could have improv the experi ar chang step and make it less vagu and sai specif re do step for a second trial etc . the student could be sure to time each trial for accur valid .
3051	2	2	1	the plastic type b ha the most elast over all the other plastic . plastic type a ha the least amount of stretchabl over the plastic . a wai he could ve improv thi experi is by averag out both time he measur the elast . anoth wai he could ve approv thi is by try out more time and then averag those out .
3052	2	2	2	it can be conclud that plastic b is the stretchiest becaus it had the highest averag and much stretch of . mm . two wai the student would have improv their experiment design ar that thei should ve includ how much weight . the weight wa and how mani clamp to us . also thei should ve us a control plastic to compar their result to .
3053	2	2	2	on conclus i ran make is plastic b wa best of stretchabl . and student could have made thi experi better by make sure the plastic were the same start size . anoth wai is thei could have ad anoth column to show at what side the plastic wa befor the experi so that you can see how much the plastic stretch .
3054	2	3	3	a . polym plastic b had the most stretchabl of mm . mm more than plastic type a mm more than plastic type c mm more than the stretchabl of plastic type d . by have more improv trial . thei should have made sure all the plastic type had the same measur in length and width . and thei could have test more type of plastic .
3055	2	3	3	a base on the student s data you can conclud that plastic type b is the most stretchabl and plastic type a ha the least stretchabl . p b on wai the student could improv is by make sure the plastic strip ar all the same length hang off the tabl from the same point . anoth improv would be to record the origin length of each plastic strip . thi would provid a constant to compar the result to .
3056	2	1	1	thi experi didn t seem to work out veri well . judg by the data tabl the experi didn t seem to prove anyth . there ar no signific chang in the length of the plastic . the first three step of the experi ar good but rather than remov the weight the student should just keep ad more and more weight until the plastic final stop . that would realli show how much the plastic could stretch . anoth wai to improv the experi is to conduct a third trial . an experi is more valid when there ar more and more trial .
3057	2	1	1	a . plastic type had more stretchabl then all the other plastic test . p b the student could have improv the test by sai how much weight wa ad dure the experi . the student could have also describ the rate at which to add the weight for consist .
3058	2	2	1	i have conclud that plastic b stretch the most . it stretch about mm in all . p name what plastic thei were . measur the plastic befor you stretch it .
3059	2	3	3	accord to the data plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic . it stretch mm in trial on and mm in trial . p on wai the student could have improv the valid of the experi would be to not just add weight to the plastic like in the procedur but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time . anoth problem would be if the plastic wasn t tape at the same distanc from the edg and if thei ar us a new set of the same plastic for their second trial .
3060	2	1	1	two wai the student could have improv the experi design is to ad differ weight to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trip . anoth is to do more than two trial to make more reliabl .
3061	2	2	2	a plastic type b ha the greatest stretchabl among the four type of plastic . in the first trial it stretch mm and in the second trial it stretch mm . plastic type a ha the worst stretchabl . in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . p b . ad mani more trial and by ad more weight to the clamp so that the plastic could stretch until it tear .
3062	2	3	3	a . base on the student data plastic type b wa the most stretchabl of the test plastic . p b . on improv would be keep the start length them same state it . second would be the amount of weight attach at each interv .
3063	2	2	2	base on the student s data it can be conclud that plastic type b ha the best elast . the student could have improv the experi by ad trial and specifi in the procedur how much weight is us .
3064	2	2	2	plastic type b ha stretch the most and a the least . d ha stai the same for both trial while c ha stretch less n dure the second trial and a and b have stretch more . two wai in which the experi could be improv is to tell how much weight to add and tell what type of plastic were us in the result .
3065	2	0	0	my conclus base on the student data is that plastic type d stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least
3066	2	3	2	plastic type be wa the most stretchabl . stretch on averag of . mm and plastic type a wa the least stretchabl stretch an averag of mm . the student could have improv the experiment design by specifi how much weight thei attach to each plastic and then keep it constant . the wai the procedur is written now we don t know if the amount of weight wa us constant .
3067	2	1	1	i can conclud that plastic c is the weakest out of all the plastic becaus it stretch the most . on wai that the student could have improv the experi is to do more than two trial in each plastic becaus two trial is not reliabl enough . also the student should have check the length of the plastic at differ time interv like everi minut so you could see how the plastic stretch over time .
3068	2	1	2	plastic type a is the strongest type and ha the strongest polym . two wai in which the experi could have been better is that the student could have ad the weight of the clamp to thi data and the student could have also ad the tabl height .
3069	2	3	3	a i conclud that plastic a is the strongest becaus it stretch the least in both trial . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi ar do anoth trial and includ the length of the plastic regard ad the weight in the result .
3070	2	2	2	war
3071	2	2	2	type d stretch the same length in test on and two . thei could have said what the start measur of the plastic and how much the weight were .
3072	2	1	2	it can be conclud that sampl b and d had higher stretchabl than sampl a and c to improv the experi design the student could have clarifi how mani weight thei were ad to the clamp becaus that should have remain constant could for accur result . also the student could have made it clear exactli where on the tabl the sampl were be tape becaus for exampl if on wa an inch onto the tabl that would take an inch off the final result .
3073	2	2	2	a . plastic type b had stretch more than plastic type a in trial and . in trial plastic type b stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm more . p b the student could have put the temperatur in the experi becaus that could ve been a caus of the amount stretch of plastic . the student could ve as put the start of how much the plastic weight in mm .
3074	2	2	2	in thi experi student tri to test the polym plastic for stretchabl . in conclus type a b stretch at least on or two mm from it origin length yet type c shrink and type d remain the same . on wai the student could of improv their experi is by ad how big or heavi the weight thei us to stretch experi is list where thei want the top of the plastic tape to the desk .
3075	2	2	2	base on these result plastic type b and d stretch the most but of the four plastic while plastic a and c sustain their shape much better . the student could have improv the design of thi experi by set on exact weight be ad to the plastic and by complet on more trial to make a total of three trial .
3076	2	3	3	a . plastic b wa the on with the most stretchabl plastic d came next follow by plastic c then a . p b . the student could have includ how much the weight weigh . thi would make the experi valid when reproduc . p also thei could have includ the initi length of the plastic befor it wa stretch .
3077	2	3	3	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic b is more flexibl . thi is becaus for each trial it stretch the most . on the other hand plastic a stretch the least becaus it onli stretch mm and mm while b stretch mm and mm . p to improv the valid of the result the student could have done a third or even fourth trial . thi addit data will make the result clearer . also the student should state how much the weight weigh so that other can reform hi experi and get similar result . he might have also want to includ how long the piec of plastic were origin .
3078	2	2	3	a base on the student data you can conclud that plastic . type b ha the most stretchabl . p b on thing the student could have done top improv their experiment design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamp . thei also could have said which side to clamp becaus edg could mean left right or anyth
3079	2	1	1	on conclus it can draw base on the student s data is that plastic type b is stretch much more mm than the other three type maintain the amount of mm in both trial . base on the data . plastic type a is less flexibl stretch mm in the first trial an in the second trial . the student could have state that thei start out with unus plastic and record their initi stretch .
3080	2	2	2	a conclus to data is that plastic type b is abl to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic type . the student could have improv the design by ad anoth trial to all plastic type also by alter the plastic to hang longer .
3081	2	3	3	accord to the graph plastic type b wa the plastic that wa stretch when plastic that wa stretch when plastic type a did not stretch as much . clearli type a is more durabl and sturdi . to improv the experiment design the student should have said what each of the start weight put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accur as possibl .
3082	2	2	2	my conclus would be that after onli two trial plastic type b prove to be the most stretchabl of those plastic . on wai thei could have improv wa to do anoth trial . anoth wai is instead of onli allow five minut thei should of let hang until it wa about to rip in then measur give it maximum length .
3083	2	2	2	a a conclus from thi data is that plastic sampl b is the the most stretchabl . p b two wai that the student could have improv the valid of the result ar make the plastic sampl the same initi size and allow the plastic sampl to stretch for more than five minut .
3084	2	1	2	a from the student result i see that plastic b wa the strongest stretch mm . plastic d wa next stretch mm . plastic c wa third stretch mm . lastli plastic a wa the weakest stretch mm . p b two wai the student can improv their experi is to do more trial for better result . also thei could increas the height of the tabl to avoid the result be tamper should the plastic stretch to the floor .
3085	2	2	2	it can be conclud that plastic a is the strongest and most durabl plastic it stretch significantli less then most other plastic with an averag of mm plastic c would be the second best becaus it stretch an averag of . mm . follow by plastic d with mm stretch and lastli plastic b with mm stretch . the student could improv thi experi by ad a control and could be more valid by make sure each plastic wa the same length .
3086	2	1	1	the plastic from t stretch a littl more than it did in t . thei could have made sure the plastic weight the same and the could of made sure the weight were all equal in each group .
3087	2	3	3	a in conclus to the result it can be said that polym b is the most stretchi follow by d then c then a . the onli problem is that you can t accur judg it becaus you can t tell if thei ar all the same begin length . a conclus would onli work if thei were the same start length . p b on wai to improv the design would be to specifi the begin length of the polym strip . anoth would be to indic the amount of weight attach to each polym .
3088	2	0	0	it seem that plastic a is the most stretchabl becaus it is the onli on that stretch longer . two wai that the student could improv the experi is to name the differ plastic . also add heavier weight .
3089	2	3	3	it can be record that abov all other test in the experi plastic type b is the most stretchabl . thi is becaus at . mm it had the largest amount stretch on averag between the two trail or all other plastic type . p two wai thi experi can be improv is to state the amount of weight us french trial with differ weight be us result could have differ from what thei should have been . also becaus the amount stretch is measur in such small increment millimet more trial should be perform to enhanc the data s accuraci .
3090	2	3	3	a i conclus all of the plastic stretch but plastic type b stretch the most in bath trial . p . b two wai the student could have improv their experi design and or valid of the result ar . thei could have told how much weight to add to the plastic . thei could have told the plastic piec origin length . those ar two wai the student could have improv their experi .
3091	2	0	0	a overal in thi experi trial had stretch more than trial . p b try ad more weight to the plastic bag and let the weight hung on the bag for a longer period of time .
3092	2	2	2	a the conclus is that all of the plastic stretch from mm mm . plastic type a stretch the least and plastic type b type b stretch the most . p b the student could did a third trial or make a fourth trial . thei could ad the temp and weight to the plastic type of the same time and then measur at the same time .
3093	2	3	3	a the stretchiest of the four materi wa b with the averag stretch of . mm s . p b the student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strip of the same length and width and second thei could have perform anoth trial for each plastic .
3094	2	2	2	a you could tell that plastic type b would be the best plastic becaus it stretch the most with weight knit . p b two wai the student could have improv were said how much the weight weigh . also thei could have done a second trial with heavier weight .
3095	2	0	0	a conclus base on the student s data would be that the plastic were other a littl more or less stretchi the second time due to it be stretch out the first time . on wai the student could have improv the experi design wa by perform a third trial without weight . anoth wai would be to allow them to hand for about minut the rd time .
3096	2	0	0	thei can conclud that even after a second trial of stretch the plastic significantli didn t stretch to much larger than trial .
3097	2	2	2	. in conclus plastic type b stretch the most becaus dure it stretch mm and dure it stretch the least . p the student could have improv the experi design by ad more wai to stretch the plastic . for exampl ad littl heat . the result could have simpli been improv with a few more trial .
3098	2	2	2	base on the student data it can conclud that plastic type d is the plastic with the most stretchabl . two wai thi experi could have been improv is by ad more trial also ad the amount of weight and be specif about the length of each plastic .
3099	2	2	2	. a plastic type b had stretch the most out of both of the trial . p b ad more trial more time for plastic to be hang .
3100	2	2	1	on conclus that i can draw from thi experi is that plastic b stretch the most for both trial . wai to improv the valid would to be add a control no weight and see if it stretch and the size of the plastic sampl just to make sure that everi plastic is the same size to start .
3101	2	3	3	a a conclus that can be made from thi data is that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . thi is becaus in both trial it stretch mm and that is more than ani other plastic type test . p b two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design wa to make the weight us for everi plastic sampl constant . also for the plastic sampl the student could make sure to have the start length fall the plastic type be the same and constant . make as mani aspect of the experi constant maker fur more all work result
3102	2	2	1	plastic type a mm t t p b mm t t c mm t t p d mm t t p wai the student could have improv . p . repeat the whole procedur time . p . measur time the sampl of on type of plastic and measur length .
3103	2	0	0	i think e .
3104	2	2	2	a conclus base on the data given is that each piec of plastic stretch around the same amount each trial . thi let you know that it hi as realli the onli amount it can given on it wasn t realli chang her multipl trai . two wai the student could have improv the valid is by make each amount of plastic the same and by us the same amount or weight for each trial .
3105	2	1	1	in conclus if the student wa to go on with the investig t will alwai have depend on the plastic up the number . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment ar the could of told us how much weight to and if thei hang the clamp for min the experi might have chang .
3106	2	3	3	a i conclud that hi club is valid base upon do multipl trial . i also notic that the most stretchabl wa b and the least wa a . p b though two trial is good it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best . also i think that thei should have measur the length of the plastic befor and have it on the the data tabl to compar the chang the occur in the plastic .
3107	2	2	2	base on the student s data c is wrong becaus the first time is stretch mm then the second time is stretch how is that possibl the second trial should be more or equal if the us the same weight . p b he could told us how much weight he us . also be could have done anoth trial to be sure hi data wa right .
3108	2	1	1	base on the student data i can sai that plastic type c can stretch the most becaus in both trial plastic type c stretch at least mm longer than the second highest plastic stretchabl . to improv the experiment design the student could have said how much weight should be attach to the clamp and exactli what step should be repeat in the second trial .
3109	2	0	0	base on thi student inform i would sai that the first exceed becaus thei went up the second time . thi mean it went farther . but for the last too the went down or stai the same . a wai the student could have improv wa to make step in the procedur more clear by sai what step to repeat . second wai thei could improv wa by for step five put more step becaus step ha like step in on .
3110	2	1	2	the student s result show that plastic b wa the most elast . plastic d wa second . plastic c wa third and plastic a wa fourth . in term of stretchabl plastic b is the most and a is the least . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid is by do more trial with differ amount of weight to realli understand how stretchi the plastic is . anoth wai it could be chang is by chang the time of the trial to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length .
3111	2	1	1	accord to the data tabl the conclus of thi experi would be that plastic type b stretch the most in both trial and trial . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design or valid of the result wa to try differ amount of weight that get attach to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for differ amount of time to see the affect it would have .
3112	2	1	1	a plastic type a ha the most stretchabl than the other plastic type . p b the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result if thei had more trial and a better control .
3113	2	2	1	a form the data tabl it can conclud that plastic a wa the most durabl when stretch and the least durabl wa plastic b . plastic a stretch mm than mm while plastic b stretch mm than mm . p b . there is no indic that after the first trial he replac the plastic which of made the result from trial b invalid . . he could have done the lab again or ad a trial and . the more you do the later the better off your result will be . it would make it more valid . . he could have also tri the plastic becaus if me great longer from anoth it would stretch .
3114	2	2	2	a i conclud that plastic type a stretch the most ml . p b to improv the experiment design and or mostli of the result speci the amount of weight ad to the clamp and make all piec of place for on uniform length .
3115	2	3	3	i have come to the conclus that plastic type b ha the best stretch abil sinc the data show it stretch mm and mm . the student could have improv the valid by make sure all the plastic start length were the same . also the weight ad to the plastic should have stai constant as well throughout all trial .
3116	2	3	3	in conclus it can be said that plastic . type b had the most amount stretch becaus it number in t and t were the highest . also the plastic type that wa more durabl and wa not stretch is much wa plastic type a becaus it number in t wa and t were the lowest to improv thi experi it would be better to includ three trial and includ the plastic type initi measur to make the data tabl more specif and effici .
3117	2	2	2	base on the data tabl plastic type b stretch the most in the minut with the amount stretch for t wa mm and for t mm . so type b had the most stretchabl . p wai the student could have improv their experi would be label the type of plastic thei were us instead of put plastic type a b c and d . and anoth wai thei could ve improv their experi would be tout how mani weight thei clamp to the plastic for each plastic . so we can see how far the plastic stretch and how mani weight were us .
3118	2	1	1	on wai the student can improv there experi is to do a other trial to see if thei miss anyth .
3119	2	3	3	a base on the student data plastic type b is the weakest plastic out of them all and the strongest polym plastic is plastic a becaus it wa stretch the least . p b the student could ve includ more descript on the plastic like each plastic length or width in order to show that everyth wa the same in length and width . also the student should includ in procedur on how mani weight thei us .
3120	2	2	2	a pass on the result plastic b is the most stretchi and a is the least . the order is from most shortli to least b d c a . p b the student could of improv experiment design by be more specif . he could chang bottom edg in step to edg of the side of the tabl . addition he could give us the weight of the clamp weight .
3121	2	2	2	my conclus from the data present is plastic type b and c through b and c increas higher but d stai constant at those were onli with two trial the student should have done more trial and should have state the length of the paper .
3122	2	3	3	a conclus that can be made base on the data is that plastic type a is the strongest . thi is true becaus plastic a stretch the least about on averag . two wai that the student could have improv their lab is by sai how long the type of plastic should be and sai how mani weight should be ad to the clamp and how mani weight should be ad to the clamp becaus there could have been an error when the plastic were differ length with differ amount of weight and thi would make the data inaccur .
3123	2	2	2	i conclud that plastic b stretch the most but plastic d wa constant . he could have ad more that s . he should us brand new plastic so the test would be accur .
3124	2	3	3	a the stretchiest kind of plastic wa type b . becaus it stretch the most . p p b the student could have given the weight and the origin length of the plastic in the procedur and made sure thei were constant .
3125	2	1	3	base on the student data it is possibl to see how much each type of plastic stretch but not how much weight wa need to stretch it that far as the origin length of the plastic . p two wai the student could have improv the experi ar to make a more detail procedur . includ the weight of the type of plastic plane instruct etc and too creat a clearer tabl that includ the type of plastic the origin length and the weight ad .
3126	2	3	3	plastic type b stretch the most in both trial on and two . plastic type a stretch the least in both of the trial . p the student could have improv the experi design by conduct more trial and so state how mani weight thei ad on top of the clamp . the result werent valid .
3127	2	2	2	a base on the data the most stretchabl plastic wa plastic b b c it stretch mm on the first trial and mm on the second trail . also the least stretchabl plastic wa plastic a b c it onli stretch in dure t dure t . plastic c stretch onli a bit more than plastic a . plastic d stretch mm s both time make it the nd most stretchabl out of the .
3128	2	2	2	a . my hypothesi wa correct plastic type a stretch the least dure the experi . i notic that the plastic that stretch the least wa most commonli us in our town to hold the heaviest item . p b . to improv the valid bail of the experi the student should have us a specif amount of each plastic not just a sampl . also the student should have stretch the plastic across a gap and place weight on top . thi would have shown a more accur assess compar to the actual us .
3129	2	1	1	base on the student data it is conclud that their wasn t much stretchabl from the plastic sampl . sampl a increas mm from t to t . sampl b increas mm from t to t . sampl c decreas by mm from t to t . sampl d stai the same in t and t . thi experi could be improv if the student had a control which would be the measur of each plastic sampl without ani weight ad . thei could also repeat the experi .
3130	2	2	2	a . plastic b wa the most stretchi . it wa mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretch more millimet . the second most stretch polym wa plastic d i remain at mm both trial . p b . the student could have improv the experiment design valid of the result by i . specifi the amount of weight ad in the experi and . thei could have tri differ wai of test the stretchabl there how us weight .
3131	2	1	1	out of all the palmer plastic type a stretch a total of mm as the best on . p to have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is .
3132	2	3	3	a in thi experi it can be conclud that plastic b had the most stretchabl with mm in trial and mm in trial . also i can conclud that plastic a of the polym plastic stretch the least with an averag of m overal . then plastic c stretch an averag of mm and plastic d stretch mm p b two wai to improv thi experi would have been to make sure each plastic is exactli the same length as the add to the end of the plastic thei could also add a rd trial to make the experi more valid .
3133	2	1	1	a in thi data it show how far differ type of plastic can be stretch . plastic type a wa stretch mm within trial and . plastic type b wa stretch mm . lastli plastic type d wa stretch mm . in conclus plastic type a wa the easiest to stretch . p b two wai it could have been improv wa a have more test and what what type of plastic .
3134	2	3	3	through thi data record from the experi we can conclud that plastic a had the strongest polym setup . thi is becaus it stretch the least throughout both trial . on wai thi experi could have been improv is by creat more content . for exampl the weight ad to the clamp should have definit been the same . also to improv valid the student should have had the same start length of plastic . thing thi
3135	2	0	0	a plastic type a wa stretchier becaus on the first trial it stretch out to mm and in the second trial it stretch out to mm . it had stretch longer but plastic type d seem to have been stronger it onli stretch mm through out both of the trial .
3136	2	1	1	a i think that plastic d in both trial had the most weight out of the three other plastic from the student s data . p b two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design is on that the student could have done five trial instead of two to see the differ . also instead of four plastic but five he or she could improv the statement too .
3137	2	2	2	in conclus in trial on plastic type b stretch the most while plastic type a wa the lowest in trial two plastic type b stretch the furthest . p measur the height of the tabl weigh the weight .
3138	2	1	1	a plastic type b wa abl to hold the most weight for each trial . p b two wai thei could have improv the experi or valid is do more trial for each plastic or thei could have let the plastic hang for longer than just minut .
3139	2	0	1	a base on the student data tabl . in can conclud that plastic type a is the strongest becaus it didn t stretch that far . in the first trial it onli stretch mm and in t it onli stretch i can also conclud that plastic type d is the weaker becaus in both trial it stretch mm . p b the student could have improv the experi either by leav the weight on longer or by add more heavier weight
3140	2	2	2	base on thi student s data the type with the most amount of stretch wa plastic type b with mm and plastic a had the least with the first trial and the second . the student could ve conduct more trial as well as state what the type of plastic were .
3141	2	3	3	the plastic with the least stretch would be plastic a becaus it had a small chang from mm to mm . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result ar have the clamp and weight be the same on everi time and make sure the plastic is on the side of the tabl not go on the top of the tabl .
3142	2	3	3	a . i conclud that plastic type b had the best stretchabl and plastic type a had the least . p b . the student should have includ in the procedur how mani weight to put on the clamp and describ where on the bottom edg of the plastic to put the clamp .
3143	2	0	0	in conclus the student data show that when the plastic wa stretch each materi stretch onli mm . thi is not a veri big chang in length . the data also show that for on of the plastic after stretch lost a mm of length . so thi wa not a veri success full lab . p on thing that thei could do to improv thi is to tell us what kind of plastic to us so the experi is easier to test and also to have a control variabl to realli see the chang in plastic .
3144	2	1	1	my conclus is that type b is the most stretchi base on the result . the student should have improv thi by do it in even trial even though . other could be how put there s experi on the tabl . thi would have improv the valid .
3145	2	1	1	a . type d plastic stretch the same amount in trial and . it stretch mm . p b . in the procedur the student can get rid of step becaus step basic state the same thing . also thei could have done three trial for more data .
3146	2	2	3	in conclus plastic d stretch more than all the other plastic two steadi trial of mm each . plastic type a b both stretch a littl more in trial and plastic type c stretch less . plastic type b stretch the most have stretch then mm . p improv . show in graph begin length of plastic p creat a t and try it onc more . p add anoth trial with differ weight .
3147	2	2	2	in conclus plastic type b is the most polym for stretchabl becaus in both trial it erect the most make it the most stretch out of the all other polym . p two wai the student could have improv is by sai which plastic the student us for each so the peopl would know if the data is correct and by sai how much weight wa us to stretch the plastic .
3148	2	3	3	a in conclus plastic type
3149	2	2	2	a plastic type b can be stretch the farthest . p b the student could have specifi how heavi the weight were . p thei could ve let the plastic hang for more than minut .
3150	2	3	2	a conclus could be that plastic type b had the best result for stretchabl with m and m . to make the experi more valid the group could have run more trial and thei also could us more detail in the procedur like state how heavi the weight were .
3151	2	2	1	i think that the data thei have is correct but it show that plastic type a is the onli on that ha a lower trial than the other type . two wai the student could have improv the experi wa to tell how heavi the weight were and what plastic wa us .
3152	2	1	1	a in conclus plastic b and d have more stretchabl than a and c becaus plastic b and d stretch an averag of mm while plastic a and c stretch an averag of mm . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar to do more trial and to add a control .
3153	2	2	2	base on the student s data it is easi to conclud that plastic type d wa the most constant through both trial with a measur of mm . the student s though could have improv their experi by do more trial and by also be more specif . for exampl sai what type of plastic thei us instead of sai a b c or d . also thei could have said how much weight wa ad so that it is clear and exact .
3154	2	1	1	a . in conclus base on the student s data polym plastic b stretch the most in both trial done the least that stretch both trial wa type a leav us to see b is the most stretchabl from all for type . p b she could have includ a time limit for the plastic to dangl freeli . second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual .
3155	2	3	3	base on the data we can tell that plastic type a stretch the least amount of all other type of plastic . it onli stretch an averag of mm which wa less than all other . the student could improv their experi by ad anoth trial . thi alwai verifi the valid of an experi . thei could also verifi how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experi .
3156	2	1	1	a conclus draw is that trail the plastic wasn t that strong to pull but trail it went far and wa stretch more . plastic type d wa the same in trail and . the student could have improv the experiment design by mayb ad anoth trial to see what you get . also thei could have us differ plastic for the trial .
3157	2	0	1	base on the student s data plastic d stretch the same length for both trial . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to on the data tabl sai how long each type of plastic is befor the student start the experi . anoth wai the student could of improv the experiment design would be to have done onli on trial instead of two .
3158	2	3	2	i cannot draw a conclus becaus import inform is miss from the tabl . the student could have improv the test by ad in the plastic length to the data tabl . thei also could have includ the amount of weight the weight weigh .
3159	2	1	2	a the student want to see which plastic wa more st recit . b two wai the student could have improv the experi is by do a rd trial sai how far off the tabl .
3160	2	3	3	a base on the data thei can conclud that plastic b stretch the most . p b thei could have includ the mass of the weight ad . thei also should have includ the size of the plastic sampl .
3161	2	0	0	my conclus is trial t stretch better than t . the student could have us a differ type of plastic and thei could have just made the sampl veri larger .
3162	2	3	3	a . base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most . plastic type stretch and mm . p b . the student could have been more specif about the amount of weight to add .
3163	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch the most probabl hefti or hillock p b taken thick temp in room origin length etc .
3164	2	3	3	the plastic type b stretch the most out of all the other plastic type . two wai the student could have improv hi experi wa to includ in hi data tabl how much weight he us on the clamp . to includ what the start length of the plastic wa in hi data tabl .
3165	2	3	3	the student want to determin in thi experi which type of plastic a b c or d wa abl to stretch the most . base on the data plastic b had the best stretchabl and wa abl to stretch mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . the student could have conduct more trial to improv the valid of their result . to improv their experiment design thei could have been more specif and state how mani weight should be ad to the plastic and to better control the experi .
3166	2	1	1	base on the data tabl i would sai that plastic d wa your strongest plastic becaus it didn t stretch . on wai thei could of improv the experi wa to run a trial to tell plastic d . anoth wai thei could of improv the experi is by ad mani weight .
3167	2	2	2	base on the student data the plastic b is the most stretchabl polym plastic . plastic a is the least stretchabl . thi is becaus plastic b wa stretch at mm st trial and mm nd trial . compar it to the other it stretch the furthest . plastic a onli stretch mm st trial and mm nd trial . to improv thi experi the student should have had a control choos a specif plastic . thei also should have done on more trial to ensur valid . three trial can help make thi definit .
3168	2	2	2	in conclus the plastic stretch more dure the second trial than the first . the second trial the first . the second trial all plastic stretch further except for type c and d which did not chang . two wai to make thi better would have been to do a third trial and to specifi how much the weight were .
3169	2	3	2	a base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most at an averag of . mm while plastic a stretch a mere mm averag . plastic d stretch the second most with an averag of mm and then plastic with . averag mm . the averag in stretchabl is due to the differ chemic composit of each plastic . p b the student could have improv the valid and design by record how much weight wa us which would allow someon to replic the experi and record the percentag stretch rather than just how much . a sampl that is cm but stretch mm is a much more signific chang than on that is meter and stretch mm but the data tabl fail to recogn that .
3170	2	1	1	in conclus all the plastic type ar all differ amount stretch . the plastic stretch out in trial ar go up and down . p the student could have improv by do a third trial to show more of the result . explain why thei ad more weight .
3171	2	3	3	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type a wa the strongest becaus it stretch the least amount . p b for the student to improv the experiment design thei could have written how much weight the put on the plastic . and to improv the valid thei should have done a third trial .
3172	2	0	0	a . in the polym investig there werent a lot of chang plastic type a stretch onli mm type b stretch mm type c stretch mm and d stai the same . p b . could of been more accur with the step on the procedur .
3173	2	0	1	a in conclus plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl and plastic type a wa the lowest . thi show that a is the most non flexibl and the most durabl to stretchi task . plastic b is the stretchiest and can hold up to mm . p thei could ve ad a list of materi in the beginn and a hypothesi to see what thei were try to test .
3174	2	1	2	the plastic type a is shown to be the the strongest plastic type . mean while the plastic type b show to be the plastic that stretch out the longest .
3175	2	0	0	in conclus base on the student data there ar four differ type of plastic . base of the plastic ar t t their amount stretch mm . and base in the dutch tabl t is more stretch than t . the student can describ experiment base in differ plastic . and the student can base in that data tabl the t is more stretch .
3176	2	3	3	a after investig how much each plastic type stretch a conclus ha made that plastic type b stretch most than d than c and plastic type a stretch the least . b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa to first us the same start length of the plastic bag that could effect the result and secondli be more specif about how much weight to add .
3177	2	3	3	base on the data plastic type b stretch the most out of all of the plastic . type a stretch an averag of mm type c stretch an averag . mm and type d stretch mm . but type b stretch cm but type b stretch the most with an averag of . mm . p b the student could have improv hi experi by tell how long the plastic wa as well as how the weight weigh . anoth thing the student can do is add on more trial .
3178	2	2	2	a conclus that can be drawn base on the student data is plastic type b had the greatest amount of stretchabl in mm . in both trial the plastic stretch further than the other type . in trial mm and trial mm . . the student could have made thi lab more valid by ad the differ type of plastic that were label a b c and d and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so thei all start at the same measur .
3179	2	2	2	a . the student could have conclud that plastic type b ha the largest amount of stretchabl becaus type b stretch min in trial on and mm in trial . p b . the student could have improv the valid of their experi by . do more trial to collect more data . . allow the clamp with the weight to hang longer than min .
3180	2	2	2	a a conclus that can be brought from the data is that plastic type b is the best type of plastic fore stretchabl becaus it stretch mm and mm on it s trial . p b two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by have or state that the plastic all had the same initi measur . also the student could have name the type of plastic . the valid can be question becaus it is unknown if thei were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown .
3181	2	2	2	base on the student data plastic b stretch more than the other plastic . the student could improv thi experi by check the temperatur of the room becaus plastic s elast vari on the temperatur . anoth improv would be to measur the amount of weight that is be put into each bag .
3182	2	2	2	the data show the plastic for stretch more in b . becaus mayb the put or did differ procedur . but experi d have the same type of stretch . the procedur ar the same or mayb he did it three time . the student have to do the procedur thei have to do the experi like three time as or more . the need to have all the materi and put it in order . the need to have hi own question . find hi conclus .
3183	2	1	1	my conclus is that plastic type d stretch the farthest both trial . thei could have done anoth trial and thei could have put more weight on the clamp so it can stretch more .
3184	2	1	1	plastic type a held up best against the weight of the height . so i would us the plastic out of ani where . plastic type d expand and stretch the most . p two wai the student could have improv the experi wa on name the plastic and two tell how much the height weigh .
3185	2	3	3	a a conclus i can draw with the data present is that some plastic ar more stretchi than other . for exampl plastic b is much more stretchi then plastic a . p b to improv there experiment design and valid the result thei could of ad anoth trial . also to sai how much plastic measur befor the plastic wa stretch .
3186	2	0	0	on wai it would have been good to improv the experi is list the step or procedur properli .
3187	2	3	3	a my conclus base on the student data would be that plastic b ha the highest stretchabl . i sai thi becaus plastic b had stretch more in minut than ani of the other plastic in thi experi . p b there ar mani wai thi student could have improv their design . on wai thei can improv their design is to provid the weight of both the sampl and weight . thei could have also add more trial to improv their design .
3188	2	1	1	a base on the data that the st record i think plastic b will work better with mm . when the stud mm and plastic t with mm when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for minut . p b anew could add more trial and try other type of plastic .
3189	2	1	1	from the student data look like the first trial were good but the second trial the plastic stretch more . it look like the second trial for a b c o hang there for a by with the weight the last trial . the student could have improv the experiment design if it would of have more plastic and add or minut to see what would happen if it stai longer then minut . anoth wai could have been if you knew how mani weight you were put on the clamp . so you will know how mani weight and how long would make thi experi improv .
3190	2	3	3	. a plastic a is the most resist and the strongest becaus it stretch the least out of the plastic . thi is due to be creat with more or stronger polym chain . p b the experi could be improv by us the same amount of the weight on each type of plastic . thi would show how the strength of the plastic differ mere accur . also the trial should be perform more than time . sinc result vari greatli by up to mm with the nd trial thi variat would be minim with more trial .
3191	2	3	3	base on the data tabl plastic type b stretch the most amount in mm in trial and mm in trial befor tap . the two wai the student could have improv their experi better is by labor how much weight wa the weight add thei to the clamp and also by ad more trial to see more accuraci .
3192	2	1	1	in the procedur it doesn t have a clear problem of what is happen on the experi . on procedur it doesn t tell you the trial that thy did for the first on . two wai the student can prove is on the last trial explain what the first trial is and not make the person read it not to know what the trial is . the last wai is for number four it sai add weight to the clamp and low them to chang for minut . how heavi ar the weight you need to us on the experi .
3193	2	2	1	a . base on the data below it is sai that the plastic could stretch depend on what or how strong the plastic is . b . explain what is clamp . have a third trial or have lest durabl plastic to do the trial .
3194	2	0	0	increas by decreas by and stai the . p b . two wai of improv p us a differ weight for second trial . p or us four differ type of plastic .
3195	2	2	3	base on the student data i can draw the conclus that plastic type a onli stretch an averag of mm so it wa the strongest and stretch out of all the other plastic type . p b . the student could have improv the experi by do on more trial for a total of three trial for each plastic type for accuraci and he she could have measur the initi length of the plastic .
3196	2	3	3	nor
3197	2	3	3	a . in conclus we found that plastic type b had the most stretchabl it stretch out the most both trial and that plastic type a wa less stretchabl . p b . two wai the student can improv there experi design is to do three more so the experi can be more valid and thei should identifi how much weight thei put on the clamp .
3198	2	0	0	on wai the cold of us rock instead of weight to improv the experi design . p second wai instead of measur the length after the weight thei should measur the length of the plastic while the weight wa ve there .
3199	2	1	1	a conclus i can make base on the student s data is that plastic a can onli stretch about mm . plastic b can stretch about . mm . plastic c can stretch about . mm and plastic d can onli stretch mm . on wai the experi could have been improv is by keep the weight ad through out the experi the same . the second wai to improv the experi is for the plastic to be measur in smaller unit rather than mm .
3200	2	1	1	a my conclus is that plastic type d wa the strongest of them all . p b two wai he can improv the experi is be us the same amount of time and the same amount of plastic .
3201	2	2	2	a the conclus i can get from the data is plastic a went from mm to mm plastic b went from mm to mm plastic c went down from mm to mm and plastic d stai at mm . p b the wai thei could improv the experiment design is by do a rd trial and show how much weight thei us .
3202	2	3	3	a . a conclus i can draw from the experi is that that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch the greatest amount of mm which wa mm in trial and mm in trial . p b . the student could improv thi experi by specifi a certain length all polym plastic should start out as so thei all begin on the same level and therefor the data is accur . also the student could specifi how mani millimet of each plastic should be tape to the tabl so thei all start put the same length make the data more accur .
3203	2	3	3	a plastic type b wa the most stretchabl while plastic type a wa the least . p b thei could add more trial and be more specif when the sai weight by ad how heavi the weight ar .
3204	2	0	0	it will be not that differ from the other test that wa done becaus if there went down or up a littl . he could have done a bar graph for the thing he wa try to figur out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it .
3205	2	3	3	a . plastic type b ha shown to be the most stretchabl polym plastic by stretch about mm . p b . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by do more trial . anoth wai would be write down how mani weight thei ad to each plastic type .
3206	2	2	1	each plastic type had stretch about millimet as where type d did not stretch much therefor the type d plastic wa the strongest . p two wai the student should have improv there experiment design would be not to us the same plastic each trial do it three time instead of two and includ the length from floor to tabl .
3207	2	2	3	a base on the student data plastic type a had the strongest resist against weight and therefor make it stronger than the rest becaus plastic a stretch mm while plastic b stretch mm . p b the student should have had the same size plastic strip for each type . a third and an averag measur for each plastic would make the data even more valid .
3208	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch the most while plastic type a stretch the least . thi show that plastic type b have less cross link of it polym while plastic a had the greatest amount of cross link . p b on wai the student could have improv their experi could be add anoth trial to get a bigger rang to make sure the data is accur anoth wai the student could have improv their experi is by ad more plastic type for a longer sampl size .
3209	2	1	1	. a . the student experi wa a good experi becaus thei had differ plastic type thei had two trial to check and reach for experi . p b . thei could have had more trial thei should had more plastic type .
3210	2	0	0	a base on the data as you see differ type of plastic thei would be differ or the same on both trial . for exampl plastic type a first . trial is werent stretchabl and when you repeat it again it would chang . p b two wai to make it better wa have more differ plastic and mayb add more weight to the clamp to see what chang .
3211	2	2	2	a my conclus accord to the data would be that plastic b stretch the most . p b some wai the student could improv their experi is if thei said how much weight wa on the plastic . also thei should of not have done the second trial exactli the same as the first caus there would be no differ so the data should be the same as the first becaus the second trial wa suppos to be done exactli the same as the first .
3212	2	3	3	a plastic type b ha the most amount of stretchabl in all the four plastic . p b the student could have repeat the experi a third time and made sure that thei were ad the same size weight everi time .
3213	2	3	3	a . plastic type b wa the polym plastic with the greatest stretch length . plastic type a wa the most resist to stretch . b . the student need to make a coupl of chang to improv the valid of the result . in step of the procedur it sai take a sampl of on type of plastic b measur it length . thi is mislead becaus all polym plastic should be the same length at the begin of the experi . thi is import b c the longest should be the piec is at the begin can affect how much it will stretch . final student need to chang step add some weight to a specif number of weight . thi is import b c if thei put more weight on on plastic it will stretch farther than a plastic w less weight attach .
3214	2	0	0	i guess when the plastic reach a certain amount it will break . p thei should of us a differ type of plastic to see how it work out .
3215	2	2	2	in conclus . plastic a wa the least stretch after two tri also plastic b wa the most stretchiest after the two tri . the student could have improv the experiment design by be more specif and also measur the length of the materi befor do the experi .
3216	2	1	1	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic type b is the strongest . for exampl in trial it stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar ad anoth trial and increas the amount of time it hang .
3217	2	1	1	a plastic type b is more flexibl and stronger some plastic stretch more after the first trial like mm mm p b i think have more trial so hi data can be more precis and have a patrol
3218	2	2	2	plastic type b is the stretchiest while type a is the least stretchi . two wai thei could improv the experi is by ad more trial and check to make sure all other variabl ar constant such as temperatur .
3219	2	1	1	plastic type b stretch more than all other plastic type . p on wai the experi could have been improv is if thei kept on ad weight until the plastic broke and measur how much weight it can hold . anoth wai is of put on plastic on top of anoth and add the weight and see if that chang how far on on the plastic stretch .
3220	2	0	0	the student conclus wa not much becaus there wa mani type of plastic to choos from . p the student could have improv the experi if the student pick a certain type of plastic not ani type . other reason is that thei not the weight in the same spot in trial and trial .
3221	2	2	2	a in conclus of thi experi plastic type b seem to stretch the most in both trial of the experi . also it seem as if plastic type a wa the stack in the experi as it onli stretch a half the amount of plastic type a . p b instead of add weight thei could have given a specif amount of time . thei also could have given the origin length of each plastic .
3222	2	2	2	a base on our result we can conclud that plastic b wa the weakest becaus it stretch the most . plastic a wa the strongest becaus it stretch the least . p b thei could have mention more content such as the weight thei put on the bag sampl everi trial . p thei should have had a control trial where no weight were ad .
3223	2	2	2	a conclus of the experi would be that plastic b wa the stretchiest plastic . also that plastic a wa the least stretchi . make all the plastic sampl the same length and make sure that t and t have the same amount of plastic .
3224	2	1	1	. a the plastic a b stretch farther the nd time but d c stai the same or went down . p b stretch it a third time or measur it when it wa hang off the tabl .
3225	2	2	2	a base on the student s data the plastic that ha ha the most stretchabl is plastic type a . it start at mm and then the weight ad on it stretch to mm . plastic type d ha no stretchabl it remain at mm for the second trial . p b on wai the student could have improv the result and valid of them is by state how much weight wa ad to each type of plastic bag . also if you record the length a wa befor ad weight you can see how for each bag stretch from itself . right now there is no constant in the experi .
3226	2	3	3	base on the student data it can be seen that plastic b stretch mm t and mm t make it the most stretchabl . p the student could have improv the experi by includ the length of the plastic befor stretch them . also thei need to includ how much weight to add to the plastic make it the same for each plastic to be valid .
3227	2	2	2	the conclus of thi experi would be that type b wa the most amount stretch it stretch then try wa meanwhil type a stretch the least . in try on a stretch nd try stretch . the two wai student can improv the experi design is to alwai give it a rd try . what is your control .
3228	2	1	1	from read thi student procedur and review their data i have realiz some plastic ar significantli better than other . the data show that plastic type b that stretch mm and mm and plastic type d stretch mm both time . type b and c becaus that tabl show a that stretch and mm ar type c stretch and mm . in conclus plastic type b and d ar much stronger than a and c . b two wai thei could have improv the experiment design is allow them to hang for more than minut to get better data . also run a third trial will improv their result .
3229	2	1	1	in the second trial plastic a the stretch increas by two bare plastic b the second trial increas by on mm almost it decreas on mm now in plastic d the stretch stai the same . two wai student could have improv their lab or valid on wa to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great chang or to see which result were closer to result on and two to make your final choic . anoth wai to improv the lab wa to try differ measur of plastic .
3230	2	2	2	accord to the experi the type of plastic that had the greatest abil to stretch wa plastic b . in both trial thi plastic stretch a few mm more than the rest . in the first trial it stretch mm and in the second mm . p the student could have improv the experi by us a certain amount of weight ad so that all the plastic would be under the same pressur and to add a control such as no weight . the control would have made a good comparison to the data gather and the amount of weight would have made creat control variabl .
3231	2	2	2	plastic type b ha the best stretchabl out of all the other plastic . two wai that the student could improv on there experiment design and val studi is by have a control and by tell the reader the amount of weight to the plastic so that thei can replic the procedur .
3232	2	2	2	base on the student data the plastic type d wa the stretchiest . and plastic type a wa the least stretchiest at of all the other plastic on wai the student could have improv hi result wa if he she ad the same amount of weight everi time . also if thei did more trial thei would probabl get more valid result .
3233	2	0	0	in conclus you can conclud that plastic b measur the longest which wa t and t also you can see that plastic type d had came the close to plastic b plastic d measur mm for both trial p b thei could improv their experi if the actual ad more minut each trial to see differ outcom and compar . also could ve ad more weight .
3234	2	2	2	base on thi student s result i can conclud that the most stretchabl plastic is type b . type b plastic stretch mm the first trial and mm the second trial . some thing that could have been done to improv the valid of the experi would be to do a third trial . in an experi can make the result more accur depend on the amount of trial there ar in your experi .
3235	2	1	1	the data show that the plastic type stretch about the same in both trial . in the procedur the student must sai which she is record the data . i think the data would have a better conclus if the student did anoth trial for each differ plastic .
3236	2	2	2	a the order from the most stretchabl to the lest stretchabl is plastic type b first d second c third and a last . plastic type b stretch the furthest at mm st trail and mm the second trial . a wa the least stretchabl and stretch mm st trail and mm the second . p b the student could have done more trail or thei could have let it hand longer .
3237	2	1	1	a in conclus base on the student data the plastic sampl stretch slightli more in the second trial . plastic type d wa the onli plastic that kept it length constant . b to improv the valid of the result i would ve measur the plastic s width . to improv the design i would ve us a fifth plastic type to expand my result .
3238	2	1	0	the plastic that were be stretch all come out to a differ length . on the second trial of stretch the some plastic somewai the number would sore the some give or take a few . the student could have improv the experi by leav the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a differ result . also the student doesn t know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have vari and chang the whole experi .
3239	2	2	3	the polym type b had the greatest stretchabl becaus it averag amount stretch wa the greatest . at . mm stretch averag it wa higher than type d s mm averag . type a and c were less stretchabl than type b by . mm and mm respect . the variabl of the result could be increas by the read the amount of trial . thi wai the averag would be closer to what thei should be . the design also could be improv by start the weight of the weight . kg and g would be a king differ on result .
3240	2	0	1	to test four differ polym for stretchabl the student would need to record the data from the investig to procedur and perform a second trial exactli just like the first trial . two wai a student could improv the experiment design and the valid of the result is first off could try two more test trial to see if the plastic type and amount stretch can be improv second off could us the conclus to help out with the experi .
3241	2	1	1	in conclus the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type b . in trail on wa state mm and trail two wa mm while plastic type a got mm for the first trail and mm for the second trail . so over all the plastic type b is the on that can hold up the longest and is more durabl . on wai thi lab could do is to add more trail . then anoth improv could be to explain onli in the produc to get three more bag .
3242	2	2	3	a after evalu the student s data it appear that plastic type a stretch the least mm mm and plastic type b stretch the most mm mm . therefor sampl b is the most stretchi . p b the student could have improv the experiment valid by specifi how heavi the weight were that were be ad to the bag . anoth wai to improv the experi design would be yo test the experi in multipl trial us a differ length of time each trial .
3243	2	3	3	a from the data i ve seen i can conclud that plastic type b stretch the most even though between both trial it onli increas mm . but on the motherland plastic type d onli hit and stai still be close to b . p b i know two wai that i could improv the experi first the student should sai how long each plastic should be second the student should sai how much weight is be put on each time .
3244	2	3	3	accord to their the student result plastic sampl a is the least stretchi while sampl b wa the most stretchi . i do not howev believ these result ar valid . thei should have us exact measur when sai to add weight to the clamp . anoth thing thei could have done wa ad a third trial for increas accuraci and to that same note come up with an averag stretch distanc for each sampl make it even more accur .
3245	2	1	1	so thei should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottl or do we time it differ on anoth . also do we us the same length for all three plastic bag or ar we spous to us a differ length for all three plastic bag .
3246	2	2	2	a the student ar try to figur out which plastic can stretch more than the other without brake ad weight . p b the student could improv the experi if thei were to add a specif number of weight to each plastic . also have the same measur size for each plastic .
3247	2	3	2	a base on the data plastic type b had the most stretchabl follow by type a c and lastli type a . p b on wai the student could have improv their experi design would be to identifi a set mass of the weight . the student also identifi a certain amount of type to have the same resist .
3248	2	1	1	as we can come to a close the student in result were veri close number when thei did trial and then trial we can see that when thei stretch both trial thei got the same answer mm . thi is what we can conclud about the data .
3249	2	1	1	from the data it s drawn that type b ha the most stretchabl than the other . in trial on it held the highest weight count for weight . in the second trial it had a total of . for the experi to give a more accur result the weight should have been ad on past the limit for each plastic . that wai data could show how mani weight each held until break strengthen the result for or against the hypothesi .
3250	2	0	0	a both plastic no matter how far it stretch weather it in trial on or trial two is that their both about the same mm mayb off by on two . p b two switch up the differ from trial to trial . also to us differ plastic to see differ result .
3251	2	2	2	a . from the data tabl it can be said that plastic a is the most stretchi and that the other plastic have littl to no stretchabl . p b . p . the length of the plastic need to be kept constant . p more trial need to be done at the minim three .
3252	2	3	3	a after find all of the measur and record the data i can see that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . then plastic type s then c and final a which ha the least amount of stretchabl .
3253	2	3	3	the student can conclud that type b wa the most stretchabl while type a wa the least . the student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretch . the student should also have the exact amount of weigh that wa to be appli .
3254	2	1	1	a the student test the plastic differ type thei al quietli had the same close to mm stretch rate . p b the student could have state how much each weight should which he could have also chang the result then measur or record the differ .
3255	2	1	1	a plastic type a wa abl to overal stretch the most compar to other three plastic type . p b the student could have improv the valid of the result by have more trial and by have a control group .
3256	2	0	0	the plastic stretch more and more each time . p i think that the student could have been more specif when write out the step becaus it would have been easier to understand the data .
3257	2	1	1	a . base on the student s data i conclud that plastic type d ha the most stretchabl than all the other plastic type . in both trial thei stretch to mm while the other plastic type didnt that far . p two wai the student would have improv the experiment design valid is did on more trial to make sure it possibl stretchabl . us same materi .
3258	2	2	2	a . the student conclud plastic b can stretch the farthest but plastic a is the most durabl . p b the student could had a control the student could have made the sampl the same size .
3259	2	0	0	on wai the student could improv the experi better is by put the plastic in both direct at the same time . anoth wai he could improv is he could add heavier weight to get better data . p in conclus when he ad the weight to on end that made the plastic stretch and increas it size .
3260	2	0	0	the conclus
3261	2	1	1	base on the student s data the conclus can be made becaus their is noth to the test the result to . thi experi can be improv by measur the initi length at the polym to show the differ in length that the weight did and allow for a conclus . thi can also improv by ad a control to test against their variabl to add to the valid .
3262	2	3	3	a plastic b is the stretch polym or plastic low of the on test it can stretch the most . plastic a stretch the least . p b the student need to specifi how mani weight should be ad how much those weight shall weigh . p the student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hang off the tabl as thi should remain the same for everi plastic type thei should be place at the same point on the tabl .
3263	2	2	2	base on the student data you can t realli come to a conclus becaus there isn t enough data . two wai the student could improv the experi ar by ad more trial to the data is better and by state that all of the plastic were cut to the same length you would want to do that becaus if the plastic aren t all the same length that could affect the data .
3264	2	1	1	a plastic b stretch the most amount therefor it is the most stretchabl . b the student could have measur the length after minut instead of minut . thei could have ad more weight .
3265	2	3	3	plastic b had the greatest stretchabl the student should have includ how much the weight thei us weigh and how mani weight thei us . also thei should have includ anoth trial .
3266	2	3	3	a plastic b stretch the most . p b the student should have kept the length and width of the plastic sampl constant and specifi how much weight to attach .
3267	2	3	3	a . plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl . p b the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of their result . thei could have specifi the amount of weight and kept that constant . also thei could have done a third trial for each plastic to increas accuraci .
3268	2	0	0	for plastic tube a and b the amount stretch went up a point . for plastic tube c it went down a point and for d the plastic stretch stai the same . p thei could of improv by let the plastic sit for a min .
3269	2	2	2	my conclus base on thi data is that plastic type b stretch the most in both the first and second trial . on wai thi student could have made their experi better would be by re arrang their procedur and do befor . anoth wai thei could have improv would be by allow the reader to know how heavi the weight were that were us in thi experi .
3270	2	2	2	a . plastic type b is the most stretchabl . p b . the valid of the experi would be improv if a control were ad . the control in thi experi would be a plastic hang off the tabl with no weight for five minut . also the experi doe not specifi whether to us the same amount of weight for all plastic or the specif amount that suppos to be us . to improv the experi the specif amount of weight should be mention and should be held constant for all plastic .
3271	2	0	0	two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design and for valid of the result wa probabl try the experi with a bigger cup not a small cup . second would be then pot more weight to the cup and then mayb their would be a differ on the experi .
3272	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch more than ani of the other type of plastic in both of it trial . p b on wai the student could have improv their experiment result would be to have a third trial of all the practic to enhanc precis and accuraci of result . anoth wai to improv the result would be to averag the figur from the trial .
3273	2	3	2	the conclus that can be made from thi student investig is that plastic type b stretch the most . to improv the experiment design the student can give a better understand on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp . thei should give more measur for that so their result do not vari so much .
3274	2	1	1	base on the data each plastic improv on t . two wai thei could have improv the experi wa by make sure thei us the sam weight for each trial and also us a stop watch to get exact time .
3275	2	2	2	in conclus plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . also plastic type a ha the least stretchabl . the student could have had anoth trial .
3276	2	3	3	base on the student s data you can draw a conclus that plastic type b stretch the farthest amount . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be by ad more trial . anoth wai would be by control the measur of the plastic and weight so each ar the same .
3277	2	2	1	most plastic stretch to inch longer on didn t stretch at all and anoth actual becom shorter . i think thi data is wrong . when you tape the plastic tape an inch on the tabl then add the inch to the final result . thei should also put a certain amount of weight .
3278	2	2	2	in conclus out of the test polym plastic plastic type b prove to have the best stretchabl becaus it stretch mm dure t and mm dure t . on wai the student could ve improv their experi is to perform a rd trial so result can be prove to be more reliabl . a second wai thei can improv is to run a trial where the plastic hold weight for mayb minut so thei could conclud if mayb some plastic would break in the process of be stretch .
3279	2	2	2	on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to add how much weight thei were put on the plastic . anoth wai thei could have improv the experiment design is to do anoth trial .
3280	2	3	3	base on the data i would conclud that plastic type b stretch the most as it had an averag of . mm stretch . on wai the student could have improv hi experi design would have been to add anoth trial so that the result would have been more valid the to more result to a rang . anoth wai the student could have improv hi experi would have been to give a specif mass for the weight attach to the plastic so that other peopl can do the experi and get the same result .
3281	2	0	0	the conclus that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial wa more success at be stretch out . two wai that the student could of improv the design of the result ar increas the amount of time the plastic wa stretch . also hei could of chang the amount weight wa on the clamp to . to me it would be also help if a control wa run to compar result .
3282	2	3	3	a from the given result on can conclud that plastic type b is the stretchiest type out of the four that were test . p b howev there ar same wai that the valid of thi experi could be improv . on improv could be to specifi the origin length of the plastic . if the size vari the data found is useless . compar . anoth improv to thi experi could be to perform more trial . you can not obtain consist a need ingredi in an ideal experi in onli two trial .
3283	2	2	2	a in conclus the plastic type d stretch the most compar to ani other plastic . p b on wai the experi could be improv would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal . anoth improv would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedur .
3284	2	0	0	a . in conclus after five minut the plastic type were stretch longer for plastic a and b . plastic c decreas in trial and plastic d stai the same . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experi ar . ad or decreas the weight amount in trial . . let the weight hang for longer shorter amount of time .
3285	2	0	1	the student should have wrote the weight of the stricter the color and more about the size .
3286	2	1	1	a i can conclud from the result plastic type a stretch the most out of all the other plastic type . p b thei could of ad more detail to the procedur . for exampl to record all our data .
3287	2	1	1	a the plastic type b wa the stretchiest and a wa the least stretchi . p b on wai thi experi design could be improv is have multipl time record the stretch length like minut . the other wai is ad more weight .
3288	2	2	2	i conclud that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl . p on wai thei could improv thi experi wa by complet three or more trial . p a second wai thei could improv thi experi is to limit the weight thei put on the plastic then have it go up as a whole .
3289	2	2	2	in the experi plastic type b stretch the most with mm in length type a stretch least with mm in stretch . c stretch the second least mm and d close follow b mm in stretch . it is veri clear that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl and type a ha the least . to improv thi experi on could design how much weight should be appli to the clamp for each repeat of procedur on each of the four plastic . also a control group could be ad .
3290	2	2	2	a conclus i can draw from thi experi is that the second trial t had increas the amount of plastic stretch all expert plastic type c which remov the same two wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa by measur the weight for each clamp and anoth wai wa to have a third trial .
3291	2	1	1	a conclus could be that differ plastic have differ amount that it could be stretch at . the student could have improv the experiment design by have trial an varieti of cup .
3292	2	3	3	a plastic type b stretch the most dure both trial of thi experi . p b first the student should have us the same length of each plastic . final the student should make sure each type of plastic is hang the same length off the tabl .
3293	2	3	3	the conclus drawn from the data would be that plastic type b stretch the most becaus it wa the longest length after be stretch . the student could improv the experi by ad more trial to get more data to drawn make accur conclus from . the student could also cut the plastic to the same start length in order to ensur that thei all have the same start and the result would be more accur .
3294	2	1	1	a the whole procedur work out well . i think the result came out to be almost the same when thei repeat it . p b i think the student should have did a third trial . also i think he should have chase two differ plastic to see how each on doe with clamp hang from them on the tabl
3295	2	3	3	in conclus to the polym investig lab it is clearli known that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl while plastic type a wa the least accord to the data collect . to improv the experi the lab tester should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and record it . also thei should ve made sure thei us the same weight .
3296	2	2	2	in conclus the polym plastic that wa the most stretchabl accord to our experi data wa plastic type a mm mm . the polym plastic that we found to be the least stretchabl wa plastic c which actual shrank it went from mm to mm . plastic b stretch mm and plastic d wa imperi to the weight and didn t chang . a coupl of wai the student can improv thi experi would be to at more trial to increas the valid and thei can specifi the actual weight that thei us for the experi .
3297	2	2	2	a in conclus it seem that plastic b ha stretch the most becaus the highest it stretch is mm and all the other we lower at and mm . p b on wai the student could have improv their experi is to tell in the procedur how long to cut the plastic so thei all start at the same size . therefor these result ar not valid becaus we don t know if thei were on even length when thei start .
3298	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch the most in both t and t . p b the student could have improv by stretch it differ in differ wai that wai you can see better as to which b stretch the best . anoth wai it could have improv would be by it sai to do thing in the same place with the same measur .
3299	2	1	1	a . the data that the student record is incorrect . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experi by ad a control and by ad anoth perform trial to the experi .
3300	2	3	3	after look at the data it show that plastic type b stretch the most at mm t and mm t . two wai the experi could have been improv could be to tell us the type of plastic and their start length . also to specifi the amount of weight that put or in step four .
3301	2	2	2	a the conclus i drew base on the student s data is that plastic type b stretch the most . p b two wai the student can improv the design and valid at the result is to state how much weight you add everi five minut and what type of plastic were us for thi experi .
3302	2	1	1	when look at the student data i can conclud that plastic type a had the least stretchabl reach mm . on the other hand plastic type b had the greatest amount of stretchabl reach mm . two wai the student could improv hi experi design is he could have us a control to have a more control experi . he could have done each plastic type with more interv such as minut minut minut and so on . thi would increas the valid of the result .
3303	2	2	2	the student could have improv the experiment design or valid of the result by . have all plastic piec be the same length . . add the exact amount of weight to each new point of plastic .
3304	2	3	3	base on the student data i conclud that plastic type b ha the greatest abil to stretch . the student could have improv their design by specifi the mass of the weight attach so the experi can be repeat and thei could have done more trial so thei could have more confid in their result .
3305	2	3	3	a plastic type b is the stretchabl polym plastic . p b the student should have specifi a constant length to be us for each trial . also the student should have specifi the weight be us .
3306	2	2	2	a after look at the student data their conclus mai be plastic type b stretch as the most becaus in t stretch mm and on t it got . compar with the other plastic type which thei lower tan and . p b two wai the student could improv their experiment design ar . p do it again . p compar their result with anoth group .
3307	2	2	1	a . base on the student data it can be conclud that plastic type b stretch the farthest . it stretch mm in t and mm in t . p b . two wai to improv the valid ar to sai how mani pound the weight ar and to state the exact name of the plastic and not just bath them a b c and d . thi would make the experi more accur .
3308	2	1	1	a the student data show that polym b d were the stretchiest while the plastic type a c were not that flexibl . b the student could have improv hi her experiment design by us a control which he she can compar the result to a plastic us . the student mai also perform more trial in order to get an averag amount stretch mm .
3309	2	3	3	i sai that type b plastic would work the best becaus it stretch more . on wai the student could have made their experi is could have us specif type of weight . we didn t know the weight of them . thei could have also repeat the trial .
3310	2	2	2	a . it is evid that polym d had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trial . it is ultim the most flexibl stretchabl substanc out of the given in the experi . p b the polym should be attach with a sturdier applic than tape . p . the amount of ad weight should be specifi .
3311	2	2	2	a in conclus i think that the plastic type b stretch the most and plastic a is the least stretchabl . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi wa by on tell us what type of plastic to us and two tell us how fare to hang it of the tabl
3312	2	0	1	a conclus that can be drawn from the data is plastic b is the strongest tape out of the other plastic . t t t t plastic d wa the second strongest and plastic a wa the weakest plastic and the second weakest wa plastic c . two wai the student could have improv the experi is by us tighter tape for ty the plastic and act the top plastic type in the wand .
3313	2	2	2	base on the data i can conclud that plastic type d is the strongest of the four type test . in order to improv experiment design or valid of the result the student could have specifi and exact number or weight ad to the clam and the kind or weight and exact weight that he wa ad to each piec of plastic . also he could have measur each piec or plastic exactli the same in order to be more precis .
3314	2	3	3	a base on the student data plastic b is the most stretchabl and plastic a is the less stretchabl plastic . p b in the student experi thei could of state exactli what wa the measur of the first type of plastic so thei can repeat it accur for the other plastic . thei could of also deem the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wish the wight thei add to get an more accur result for the stretchabl of the plastic .
3315	2	1	1	the conclus is there might have been some problem in the student s experi . some valid issu could be that the five minut the weight and clamp that had to hang could have not been a fuller exact minut . also the spot were the plastic were place could not have been the same spot everi time .
3316	2	2	2	a a conclus that can be drawn base on thi data is plastic type b ha a higher stretchabl than the other type of plastic . the independ variabl is the type of plastic . the depend variabl is how far it can be stretch p b the wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to actual name the plastic and to tell us what the actual length wa in the begin . by tell us the name we could replic thi experi better . by tell the length of the plastic in the begin we could see the chang that occur .
3317	2	2	2	a . the conclus of thi experi wa to find the stretchabl of differ plastic . in the data result i found that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl of the four plastic in both trial and trial . p b . what were the weight of the weight that were us . how long wa the length of the string that wa attach to the weight .
3318	2	3	3	base on the result plastic a is the least stretchabl and plastic b is the most stretchabl . the student could improv the experi by give the exact amount of weight to be us so that the experi can be redon it need . the student could also make each plastic sampl the same start length to rule out length as a variabl .
3319	2	1	1	my hypothesi wa correct the second trial didn t stretch the plastic further than the first trial . p on wai the student could have improv the experi would be describ the length of the plastic befor be stretch . second the student could have also allow the plastic to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accur result .
3320	2	1	1	base on the follow data on the polym investig i can make a conclus that the plastic d type is the most stretchi . also the trial veri similar but onli averag by mm becaus the stretchi less . either increas or decreas . if a student were to complet thi experi all over again i would suggest that thei chang the wai thei set up the experi becaus it wa veri complic which lead to mani error . the student should also test the experi more time to see a rang of result .
3321	2	2	2	the conclus that i have drawn from thi experi is that plastic type b wa abl to stretch the most . on wai the student could have improv thi experi would have been thei could have done a third trial to ensur the valid of the plastic stretchabl . the student also could have been more specif in their procedur . thei should have specifi the plastic type to us in step on and sai what measur type to us in their experi .
3322	2	1	2	a . base on the data it seem type is amount stretch is the same . the other plastic type stretch differ on both trial . p b . the student could run more trial to get a good result and thei could measur the plastic after thei put the clamp on the plastic and befor thei put the weight on .
3323	2	2	2	a what the data tabl show is that plastic type a and b stretch addit length in trial second trial . plastic c stretch length in trial two and d didn t stretch farther in trial two then on . p b thei can increas the number of trial for those experi furthermor thei should give the exact amount of the weight the us for experi us gram .
3324	2	2	2	base on thi data i can conclud that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl at mm the first trial and mm the second trial . on wai to improv the valid is to have more trial minimum . and anoth wai to improv the valid is instead of time you should see how much weight it can hold befor break by ad more weight at interv .
3325	2	3	3	base on the student data i can examin that plastic type d wa prepar ned correctli becaus the trial record the same length but plastic type b stretch farthest . two wai the student could improv the experiment design or valid is to creat more trial to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measur for each plastic type and trial test .
3326	2	2	2	accord to the data shown plastic type b wa the strongest and plastic type a wa the least strongest . the group experiment design would of been posit improv if thei includ what plastic thei were us instead of sai on type of plastic if the group includ the origin length of the plastic it would of much both their experi and valid better .
3327	2	1	1	base on the student data it show that t and t ar show that most of the experi chang on the second trial and a coupl stai the same as the first trial . p the student could have improv their experi by list what the type of plastic is on the graph . thei also show have weigh each weight to make sure thei ar all the same . thei also could have hung the wight from the same distanc on the plastic .
3328	2	2	2	a plastic a stretch out the most with mm . b the student could have had anoth trial to test valid . and also have start out with the same length for everi plastic .
3329	2	2	2	a base on the tabl below i can infer that t stretch out more than t . p b two wai the student could have imperi there ex er santa is is on thy could have gave how long the plastic wa befor thei stretch it so i can now the amount of the length stretch . anoth thing word have to be is what thei tape it the should of have us someth more stronger like anoth clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end .
3330	2	1	1	the sampl of plastic a stretch the least mean it wa the strongest . the sampl of plastic d stretch the most mean it wa the weakest . p the student could have improv the experi by have a control sampl plastic a b c and d with no ad weight . anoth wai to improv thi experi would be to have more trial for each kind of plastic .
3331	2	0	0	in conclus plastic type a and b did stretch but plastic type c got smaller and plastic type d stai the same . p the student could have found anoth wai to stretch the plastic . their data could have been put clearer also .
3332	2	0	0	in conclus what all of the plastic type a b c d stretch at least a millimet per trial . two wai the student could have improv the experi wa to have a control sampl for each type plastic befor thei were stretch and the student should have been more specif about what type of plastic thei us .
3333	2	0	0	a conclus base on the student s data is that plastic type d wa stretch the most . two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design would be to vari the weight and amount place on the plastic and to vari the time for the trial .
3334	2	3	3	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type b is the most stretchabl and sturdi polym just becaus it stretch more than ani of other plastic type in both trial . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result would be by includ in the procedur the size of the weight us and the name of the differ plastic in case anoth student want to replic thi experi . also he she could have told us the start size of the sampl plastic prior to it be stretch
3335	2	2	2	a . plastic type d had the most stretchabl compar to the other plastic test . p b . thei should have been more specif about their mass g of the weight us . thei should have also state how long their plastic sampl were at the begin of the experi and how long after thei were stretch .
3336	2	2	2	conclus plastic b d stretch significantli more than plastic a c . the student could have improv their design by start with plastic of all the same length . thei also should name a common valu for all the weight .
3337	2	3	3	a . that substanc b stretch the fastest and then d then c and final a would stretch the least amount . p b . the student could have given the origin length of the plastic . the student could have specifi how much the clamp and the weight weigh .
3338	2	3	3	a from thi data it can be conclud that plastic type b is the most flexibl becaus it ha the longest length stretch in both trial and addition . plastic type a is the least flexibl sinc it had the shortest length stretch in both trial . b on wai the experiment design could be improv is by ad more trial for each plastic becaus more trial lead to more accur result . addition the design could show how much weight is us on each plastic becaus if the weight ar not the same for each plastic and trial the result ar clearli not valid .
3339	2	3	3	in conclus type a is the strongest plastic and type b is the weakest plastic . p in thi experi thei should have more trial than just . p thei also should have put how much weight thei us and if it wa the same amount of weight .
3340	2	2	2	the conclus that wa drawn wa that plastic type a had the longest length after be stretch with weight . the student could have improv the experi by have more than two trial and also by be more specif about the amount of weight that were us .
3341	2	2	2	plastic type d is the most durabl . it had the most amount stretch . the student should have wrote in the measur of the befor stretch length and how mani weight to add when stretch .
3342	2	3	3	a base on the result plastic type a wa the least flexibl while plastic type b wa the most flexibl . p b the student doesn t sai where on the tabl to tape the tap edg of the sampl . the student us sampl with vari length therefor make hi result invalid .
3343	2	2	2	my conclus is that plastic type b stretch the farthest than the other . two wai could of improv their experi is ad more trial and ad weight to the bag .
3344	2	3	3	accord to the data plastic b seem to have stretch the most while plastic a stretch the least . p the experi could be improv in two wai the plastic length wa not constant and will affect the result . the plastic should be a set length . the weight of the weight should be specifi so that other mai similarli recreat the procedur .
3345	2	3	3	a conclus i can draw base on the start end data is that plastic type b had stretch the most at the end of both trial . also i can draw the conclus that type a stretch the least after both trial . wai the student could have improv the experi or valid of the result ar to control variabl and perform more trial . thei could have improv the experi by control the number of weight type of clamp and the height that the plastic hung from .
3346	2	2	2	a on conclus that can be made is that the strongest plastic is a becaus it stretch the least in both trial . b on wai the student could have improv thi experi would have been to also test a control . thi experi need someth to compar to or els the result ar not total valid . someth els the student could fix is to be more specif in thi procedur . most of the procedur is veri vagu it would be quit differ to try to re perform thi experi with thi procedur . for exampl the procedur sai add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minut . the reader doe not know the weight or size of the weight her doe he know where to put them .
3347	2	3	3	a the conclus ha been drawn that plastic type b stretch the most . p b two wai to improv thi experi would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavi the weight should be .
3348	2	1	1	i conclud that plastic type becaus the strongest becaus it wa the strongest the first and second trail . p thei could have made none trail and add more weight on the plastic see how had it work .
3349	2	2	2	base on the student data i ca n sai that plastic a wa the strongest becaus it bare stretch . two wai in which the experiment design valid of the result could have been improv were to label the plastic and in put the length of the plastic befor it wa stretch .
3350	2	3	3	a . plastic type b stretch the most out of all the plastic . therefor plastic type b is the weakest . p b . two wai the student could have improv their experi is clammi how much weight is put on to the clamp . also thei should do on more trial to make the experi more accur .
3351	2	3	3	base upon the student data displai that plastic type b is the most flexibl compar to the other three type of plastic . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to do the standard trial instead of two and also to further improv the student s avoid of their result would be to record a befor and after measur as well as the averag to hi tabl to make hi more more clear or valid .
3352	2	3	3	the plastic that stretch the most wa b . thi student could improv by record the amount of weight us and have the same amount of weight for each thei could have also ad the length of the plastic to show .
3353	2	1	1	the conclus i can draw from base on the student s data is that a . b increas while c decreas and d stai the same . wai the student could have improv the experi is by st the wai the decid to do the experi . thei should have check to see if after the st trial if it would go back to it normal form . nd thei should have mention what the size wa befor the experi wa start .
3354	2	1	1	plastic d is con ci cast with how much it stretch state that thei ar us differ plastic state the weight that wa ad .
3355	2	1	1	i conclud plastic polym d ha the most stretchabl and polym plastic a ha the least stretchabl . the student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piec then averag the total togeth for t and t for each trial . the student also should have set how thi piec of plastic is hang freeli that tell me noth or how to repeat it .
3356	2	3	3	a my conclus base on the student data is that plastic type b is the most stretchabl becaus for both trial it stretch more than all the other plastic type . b two wai the student could have improv the design could be to specifi how mani weight thei ad to the clamp and thei could of also us someth sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn t come off the tabl .
3357	2	2	2	a base on the student s data plastic b stretch the most by mm and plastic a stretch the least with about mm . plastic had the second strongest stretchabl with mm and then plastic with mm . b the student could have improv the experi by record the averag amount stretch . thei also could have made sure all the plastic had same begin length .
3358	2	3	3	a . plastic type a wa made of the least amount of polym becaus it stretch the least and plastic b wa the most . p b . the student could have written the measur of the plastic befor thei stretch them and thei also could have specifi how much weight thei held part on the clamp .
3359	2	2	2	a accord to the result t had stretch the most mm than t . p b the student should have said how big the clamp should have been and how heavi the weight should have been .
3360	2	2	2	plastic type b stretch the most of all . thei should have specifi the mass of the weight us .
3361	2	3	3	base on the data i can includ that plastic b ha the most stretchabl . it had the most stretch for both the first and second trial mm and mm . to improv thi experi i would specifi how much weight us in each type of plastic and i d make that a control variabl . i would also includ the length of the plastic befor it wa stretch so i can get a better idea on how stretchabl the plastic realli is
3362	2	3	3	a base on the data i have seen plastic b seem to be stretch out the most mean it s too durabl . and plastic a seem to be stretch out the least mean it s more durabl . p b on wai to improv thi experi is by tell us the amount of weight the student ad to the clamp . also to get better result the student should ve conduct a third trial .
3363	2	2	2	base on the data that is record is that thei ar differ here of them had the same length when start and plastic a stretch the most . p thi student could improv thi experi by have the four sampl all the same length also to could at told us how much the weight should be and should not chang .
3364	2	2	2	a . plastic type b stretch the furthest with mm on t and mm on t . plastic type a stretch the least with mm on t and mm on t . p b . on wai would to have the same start length for each plastic . a second wai would be to us differ weight that weigh more or less .
3365	2	2	1	plastic a wa the strongest of the plastic as it stretch the least while plastic d wa the weakest as it stretch the most . p on wai the student could of had a better experi is to do more trial as it would give more precis data . the second wai to improv the experi would be to try the plastic in differ condit such as heat or cold to see if that affect the strength .
3366	2	0	0	well the t wa higher except for c p the student could have told us how much time we have in between befor we check again .
3367	2	2	2	a base on the student data it show that plastic type b is the best choic becaus it stretch up to mm which is farther than the other . p b the two wai that thei can make the experi better ar ad more trial and ad more control to make sure that everyth is constant .
3368	2	1	0	a when test our hypothesi the had came to a conclus . it seem to be that when we test the plastic type by stretch it we had found out that when stretch a second time the number seem to have went up and then on plastic type d it stood at . p b the student could have improv their experiment design if thei would have told us what type of plastic thei had us . also thei could have ad how mani time thei did both trial .
3369	2	3	3	plastic b wa the most stretchabl . it stretch mm that and mm that plastic a wa the least stretchabl . it onli stretch mm in trial and mm in trial . plastic d wa the nd stretchiest with mm in the first trial and mm in the nd trial . and plastic c wa the rd stretchiest with mm in the st and nd mm in the nd trial to improv the experi thei could have us the same length of plastic preced the stretch .
3370	2	0	0	plastic type d stretch the most but on the second trial plastic type a made the most differ . to improv thi project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surfac to see if graviti would stretch it more . also the student could have put weight in the middl of the plastic to test if it middl would stretch more and be more durabl .
3371	2	2	3	base on the data plastic b is the most stretchabl and plastic a is the least stretchabl . p the student could have improv their experiment design and valid by attach the clamp to the same place each time . the also should have had a control which would have been the plastic with the weight .
3372	2	1	0	the plastic that stretch the most would be plastic type a becaus it went from to when the other increas by on or none at all . the student could ve test more plastic or us a differ method to stretch the plastic .
3373	2	1	2	in conclus accord to the result of the experi on the other hand plastic type a had the least amount of stretchabl leav plastic type c and d somewher in between them . two wai the student could have improv the experi would be test each plastic type on or two time for more reliabl . on the student could have test more plastic type or ad differ weight .
3374	2	1	1	a plastic type a had the most resist it did not rip that much especi compar to plastic type b . p b instead of let them hang for minut make it less to be more effect .
3375	2	0	0	my conclus is that plastic type d is best becaus the amount stretch stai the same throughout test trial and test trial . two wai the student could have improv the experi is allow the weight to hang longer than minut and or add a heavier weight .
3376	2	1	1	a some plastic could stretch a lot more than other . plastic b stretch the most . p b . the student could ad differ weight on it and see if that chang the result .
3377	2	3	3	accord to the student s data plastic type b seem to be the most stretchabl and plastic type a seem to be the most durabl . i think thei should have done a third trial and specifi a certain weight amount .
3378	2	2	2	a base on the data plastic materi a wa the most durabl out of the four test . thi is becaus plastic a onli stretch mm on the first trial and on the second while plastic b stretch mm plastic c and and plastic d each time . thi mean that plastic a toler the weight on the clamp the best and also that plastic b toler it the least . p b the student could have improv their experi by us a varieti of differ weight to get a wider rang of data and by do more trial to allow for the most accur data possibl .
3379	2	0	0	i think thei should of kept the time the same becaus on thi chart the time ar differ then the origin time . so defend talli improv by keep the time same .
3380	2	2	2	a after view the data it is clear that type b ha the greatest stretchabl with mm and mm compar to type a s mm and mm . also type d is the most accur becaus mm wa reach in both trial . p b thi student can improv the design by specifi how mani of what amount weight he us . thi will give him more control over the experi . also he should have a control plastic to compar the result of the other to . the control should be either stretchabl or veri durabl .
3381	2	1	1	my conclus is that plastic type is go to be more long becaus it look as if the student ad more weight to it . the student could have improv thi assign by state specif how much weight to add to the clamp also thi experi could of been more success if the student had differ type of plastic sampl to measur .
3382	2	2	2	conclus type b of the plastic wa the least strong and stitch the most type of wa the strongest and onli stretch about mm . two war the student could of improv the experiment risen would have more trial and what is the length of the plastic .
3383	2	1	2	the conclus base on the student data show that with the same weight but differ type of plastic ar differ . the student could have ad more trial and ad more weight to there experi .
3384	2	0	0	conclus type d plastic ha more stretchabl becaus the a mount stretch is t t . on the first step the should be more specif for the type of plastic . for the fifth step should includ in what direct to measur the plastic type after re move the weight .
3385	2	3	3	in conclus plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . on wai to improv the experiment design is to make sure the same amount of weight is us for each plastic . anoth wai to improv the experiment design is to run anoth trial .
3386	2	1	1	a . plastic type a wa mm that had chang the most . from trial to trial it had increas by a go from to . p b on wai the student could ad improv thei re experi is by do more track . anoth wai the student could ad improv there experi is by ad heavier weight to the bag .
3387	2	3	3	a a conclus that i can draw from the student s data is that plastic type b stretch the most . i know thi is accur becaus dure the second trial it come to be about the same . p b to wai the student could have improv the experi ar p he she should have ad how much each weigh and he she should have put the length of the plastic befor thei were stretch in her data .
3388	2	2	2	consid the plastic wa alreadi stretch . it wasn t as strong as it should of been on the second trial . the student could of told how long the plastic wa befor it wa stretch . he could of also told how heavi the weight were .
3389	2	0	0	the wai thei could had improv the experiment design or the valid result is by ad more to it to make it higher than it is .
3390	2	0	0	i conclud that all plastic type stretchabl is good except d . the student could had improv the experiment design by all of the plastic be known in prior knowledg that it would stretch . anoth wai would be that thei could of see how much of someth it could hold .
3391	2	2	2	plastic type and c were stiffer while type b and d stretch more . thi student could have suppos thi experi by ad a third trial for more accur data and by ad the origin length of each peac of plastic to tabl that he made . the origin length would better the understand of the data by whoever is read the tabl becaus thei would be abl to see what length the plastic start at .
3392	2	1	1	wai thi student could have improv thi experi b by do more trial so their result done out better . also thei could have hung the weight for a longer period of time .
3393	2	2	2	in conclus trial ani
3394	2	1	1	the amount of stretch in t and t lie wa a littl differ t wa greater than t in plastic a b and c but in plastic d thei had the same amount of stretch . p what the student should do to improv hi experi is to add more trial .
3395	2	3	3	base on the result of the experi plastic type b had the least overal stretch . although the group result ar not valid . there ar two wai to improv the experi in an experi you should alwai construct trial to valid your result also all of the sampl should be exactli the same length .
3396	2	2	2	a plastic b stretch the most out of all therefor plastic b ha the greatest level of stretchabl . p b the student could have chang the test variabl the nd trial or he she could have perform an addit trial .
3397	2	2	2	to improv the valid of the trial the student could add anoth trial for each of the plastic strip . to improv the experiment design the student should mention the exact amount of the weight us on the plastic .
3398	2	3	2	base on the student s investig i conclud that plastic type b and d ar weaker polym than plastic type a and c . both b and d stretch much farther than a and c which indic that their polym chain ar not as strong . thi student could improv the experiment design by us the same length of each sampl to ensur that it is not a variabl . also the student cold have us a set number of weight to make sure each sampl wa stretch by exactli the same forc .
3399	2	2	2	conclus there wa a small differ between the first and second trial for each plastic . the student could have improv the valid by do a third trial . thei could of improv the experiment design by state how much each weight weigh .
3400	2	2	2	plastic b is the stretchiest plastic . it stretch the most out of both trial than all the other plastic . p the student could have specifi what weight to us so each plastic is be pull with by the same weight . differ weight would affect accuraci neg . the student also would have made sure the initi were of the same condit befor be test . for exampl if a plastic wa heat befor the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that wa cool lastli . the student could make sure each test wa in same environ .
3401	2	0	0	b on thing thei could ve improv on would be the descript on the step explain it more with detail . anoth thing the student could work on would be to defin the control . p a polym investig .
3402	2	3	3	a my conclus is that plastic b wa the stretchiest . p b to improv experiment design and valid the student should have specifi how much weight he us to put on the end of the clamp to stretch the plastic . also there should have been a control to compar the result to at the end . also there should have been a third trial so the experi would be more valid .
3403	2	1	1	the conclus
3404	2	1	1	a a conclus of thi procedur would indic the plastic debil to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastic is more durabl or unstretch than the other . p b on wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be state the type of plastic us . anoth wai would be by determin how heavi the weight were on the clamp .
3405	2	2	2	in conclus base on these lab result plastic type b wa stretch the farthest where plastic a wa stretch the least . on thing the student should do to improv their experiment design wa list what kind of plastic thei were instead of just name them plastic a plastic b etc . also to improv their valid of the experi thei should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trial were right .
3406	2	1	1	a conclus of the student s rest of stretchabl on polym is plastic type b is the stretchiest becaus it stretch out the most out off all the other plastic . plastic type a would be the least stretchiest becaus it stretch out the least out of all the other plastic type . wai the student could have improv the result ar increas the number of plastic be test so that you have more result ar increas the number of plastic be test so that you have more result the second wai is add more weight when stretch out the plastic so you can see how thei react under more weight pressur .
3407	2	3	3	accord to thi data tabl plastic type b ha the best stretchabl than the stretchabl of plastic type a . p b . tore more accur sai how much the weight weigh and that you have been us the same for the same amount of time . also make sure that the student is us the same amount of each plastic .
3408	2	0	0	the type stretch out differ depend on how much weight wa put on them .
3409	2	1	1	plastic polym d ha the most stretchabl . it is more durabl . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design an valid of the result would be to have a few more trial and test the plastic for minut .
3410	2	1	1	in conclus plastic type d base on our data stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least . type d stretch for both trial while type a stretch for ti and for t . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to do anoth trial . also to averag the data out .
3411	2	1	2	a . a conclus base on the student data that thei found out plastic type b wa the best kind of plastic in thi experi and plastic type a wa the strongest . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experi wa to add more trial becaus isn t enough and to tell us what to measur the length of the plastic with .
3412	2	2	2	a the conclus i can conclud from the data is that plastic b stretch the farthest in both of the trial . p b more trial . p add anoth type of plastic .
3413	2	3	3	a plastic type b ha the greatest stretchabl it stretch and mm in both trial while the other plastic stretch between and mm . p b the student could improv thi experi by ad more trial and by measur mass of the weight .
3414	2	3	1	in thi lab a student investig the stretchabl of four differ polym plastic a b c and d . after two trial of each polym the student conclud that plastic type b had the most stretch strength out of all that were test . two wai the student could have improv thi experiment design wa to make sure the tape that wa hold the type of plastic wa secur enough to withstand the weight of the clamp and other weight . anoth improv could have been to measur how much of the plastic you tape down .
3415	2	3	3	a plastic type b wa the onli polym plastic that wa abl to stretch out the most while plastic type a wa the onli polym plastic that did not stretch out a lot . p b on wai that the student could have improv the experiment design would be to state how mani weigh to add on the clamp . anoth wai that it could ve been improv wa to do more trial .
3416	2	2	2	a conclus to be drawn is plastic type b is the most stretch and plastic a is the strongest . two wai to improv the experi would be not sai exactli and instant sai repeat step and to keep the length and width of the plastic constant
3417	2	2	2	a a conclus that i can draw base on the student data is that plastic b stretch a lot more then ani of the other plastic and plastic a is the least stretchi . i know that becaus plastic b s lowest trial wa trial with mm stretch which higher than ani of the other on the data tabl . also plastic a s highest wa in trial at mm stretch and that the lowest on the board besid it own t . as you can see the conclus i drew and why it is an accur on . b . two wai it could have been improv wa by do trial by the more trial the more accur the experi is and you re suppos to do . he should have allow the them to hang for more then minut in step . thi wai it will have more time to stretch .
3418	2	3	3	base on the student s data the order of stretchabl for the plastic type from greatest to least is b d c a . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design valid of the result would ve been to us the same clamp for all the experi and to us the same amount of weight .
3419	2	1	0	a conclus i can draw is that plastic type b can be stretch the most at mm . plastic type a wa the meekest stretch at mm . p two wai ar do a control and do it for a longer time .
3420	2	0	0	both plastic type b and d stretch out of all the plastic type . he could have list all materi first . also he could have time longer .
3421	2	2	2	the purpos for thi experi wa to investig which of four polym plastic is best in term of stretchabl . accord to the data tabl plastic type b is higher regard stretchabl have the most mm s in trial mm and trial mm while the least stretchabl is plastic a have mm in trial and mm in trial . two wai of improv result valid would be by test not just stretchabl but abras and other techniqu increas the amount of trial for greater data .
3422	2	2	2	accord to the data plastic type d wa most like a hard type of plastic such as a water bottl or milk jug becaus it didn t stretch at all . two wai the student could have improv the experi would be to add the constant of how much weight wa ad . thi is necessari so each plastic is be test the same . a second wai to improv the experi is to us the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar .
3423	2	3	3	plastic type b wa the most stretchiest plastic type a stretch the least . plastic type c a b stretch the second least while plastic type d stretch the second most and wa constant with mm . the student could have improv the design by creat more trial for more valid result . more trial can show a trend in the data while onli two can t . the student also should have clarifi how much the weight should weigh when ad and when to add them to the clamp .
3424	2	1	1	after read the record data from the investig i can conclud that out of plastic a b c and d plastic a and b both increas in mile meter oppos to c which decreas after the second trial while plastic d stai the same dure both trial . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be by leav the the clamp on the plastic for longer that minut anoth would be to perform a third trial .
3425	2	3	3	plastic type b is the most stretchabl with mm and plastic type a is the least stretchi it onli stretch mm . howev in order for thi experi to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do thi then you cold get a more accur data .
3426	2	0	0	a . base on the data i conclud plastic d is the stretchiest type of plastic . in both trial the plastic stretch the same amount mm p b . on wai the student could have improv the experi wa to record anyth that went wrong . anoth wai wa to creat a graph .
3427	2	0	0	my conclus from the data is that a stretch mm b stretch mm c stretch mm and d stai the same at mm . p name the plastic be us . add how much each plastic stretch .
3428	2	3	3	base on the student data plastic type b is the stretchiest . on wai thei could have improv their experiment design is by creat a control length for each of the plastic type . anoth wai thei could have improv the valid of the experi is by ad more trial becaus by perform more trial fluke will not greatli affect the data .
3429	2	2	2	base on the student s data you can tell that on plastic type a and is continu to expand after thei ar stretch a second time while plastic type c and d do not . the student could have improv the experiment design by specifi how more weight thei ad to the plastic and ad a rd trial . those improv would clear up everyth in the experi .
3430	2	3	3	a conclus base on the tabl is that plastic type b wa the strongest becaus stretch veri much and it did not break . two wai the student could have improv the experi is specifi how much weight to add to the plastic and tell us how long the plastic sampl should be .
3431	2	1	1	conclus drawn from thi experi is that plastic type d had stretch the most and is most flexibl . while plastic type a had stretch the least and is the least flexibl . the student could have state what the type of plastic were though . so instead of separ them by letter who d know exactli what thei ar . he should of also said how heavi the weight would be and made sure thei were all kept the same weight .
3432	2	1	1	a the type of plastic that stretch the highest amount of mm wa plastic type b with a total of mm . the record trial wa more than the first trial as shown on the data tabl . p a wai that the student could have improv the experiment design could be to stretch the plastic with your hand . a second wai would be to wait more than five minut to take the crop off .
3433	2	3	3	base on the result from the data tabl the two trial do not differ much but the second trial had a coupl longer length so someth could have been done differ from the first trial . the data should that plastic b stretch the farthest dure the first trial and that it is the stretchiest the wai the student could have improv the design or valid of the result is to repeat it more trial exactli like befor to ensur the result ar accur . a second wai the student could have improv the experiment design is to sai how much weight to add to each plastic instead of just sai chang .
3434	2	3	3	a in conclus plastic b stretch the most end with a total of mm of stretch plastic the least effect plastic in stretchabl wa plastic a onli stretch a total of mm . b keep the amount of weight constant at a specif measur . measur the plastic make them all the exact same size with specif number .
3435	2	3	2	base on the student data i conclud that plastic type b stretch the most after five minut . plastic type a stretch the least . the student should of told us how mani weight to add to the clamp and how much each weight weigh . thei also should of told us what type of plastic thei were us .
3436	2	0	0	two wai the student could have improv the experiment design or valid of the result is thei could be more specif and could of wrote a conclus sai which plastic type ha more stretchabl instead of draw a data tabl . to show how much a the stretchabl of each plastic .
3437	2	0	2	base on the student s data plastic b and d stretch almost twice as much as a and c so therefor b and d ar most like made of branch chain polym wherea a and c ar made of linear polym . the student could have improv hi or her procedur by clarifi where exactli the plastic were tape on the tabl in order to keep the data constant . if the tape wa slightli higher we for some plastic thi and have affect the data . the student should also clarifi where to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reason .
3438	2	1	1	a plastic type b ha the most tensil strength and plastic type a hat the least tensil strength . b the student could have ad a control and specifi how much weight were ad .
3439	2	2	2	a base on thi data the student can conclud that plastic b is the stretchiest sampl . p b two wai the student could improv their experi would be to us a fresh sampl for each trial thei could also ad the same weight consist infanc for each sampl .
3440	2	3	3	the conclus is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest . p how much weight to rise . p did a third trial .
3441	2	2	1	base on the data tabl plastic . type a b c and d . plastic a wa the weakest becaus it stretch mm to mm . the student could have made thi experiment better if the do more trail and the temperatur of the plastic .
3442	2	3	3	plastic type b is the polym plastic with the highest stretchabl becaus in both trial it had stretch the most . thi experi is not veri valid becaus the differ polym plastic start at differ length which mai have an effect on how much it stretch . also the measur of the weight weren t specifi .
3443	2	2	2	a . plastic type a wa the most stretchabl of all plastic test . b . on wai the student could improv the experiment design and valid of the result is if thei repeat the test on each plastic sever time to ensur their result were correct . anoth wai that thei could improv the design is if thei specifi amount of weight ad to the clamp then did trial with a differ amount of weight .
3444	2	2	2	a if you tape a plastic sampl to a tabl and attach a clamp with weight on the bottom then plastic type c will stretch the longest becaus it is the thickest out of all the plastic . p b two wai the student could improv wa to add more trial and make sure to us the same amount of weight for each plastic .
3445	2	2	2	a the plastic that is most stretchabl is plastic b and the least stretchabl is plastic a . p b the student could have put the origin length of the plastic into hi tabl without the origin length it is actual imposs to see which on stretch the most . plastic d look like it stretch a lot accord to the graph but it origin length could have been . the length of the plastic sampl should also be the same . if there is on sampl that is shorter than the other the result will not be accur .
3446	2	0	0	a the conclus to my investig is at the end of my investig plastic d came out even in the second trail for t and t when stretch . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi is by tell us what plastic to us . for exampl plastic bottl or wrap . also tell us how long do thei want the plastic stretch .
3447	2	3	3	a . plastic type a stretch the least out of the other in both trial . plastic type is stretch the most in both trial . the student did not have a control variabl . p the student could have measur each plastic befor ad weight to make a control each plastic type had to be the same length . could have done more trial to make the experi more valid
3448	2	1	2	a plastic type b is the most stretchabl . p b . make sure to sai what kind of tape is be us scotch tape would be too weak . also when sai perform a second trial t exactli like the first trial t it can t be exactli the same . you have to us new sampl of each type of plastic a b c d .
3449	2	1	1	base on the experi s data the plastic a through c stretch up down . howev plastic type d did not chang at all in both trial . plastic a s amount of stretch went up by . plastic b s stretch amount went up by onli on . plastic type c also onli went up by . the student could have improv the experi by have more test have a control .
3450	2	2	2	a conclus for thi experi is that there must have been a possibl error somewher make the data unreli . thi is becaus the result ar inconsist . p on wai the student could have improv the experi is to have done more trial . anoth wai the student could have improv the experi is to measur the exact weight put on the clamp .
3451	2	2	2	in thi investig the conclus is that plastic type b stretch the most in both trial . as you can see in the data tabl plastic type b stretch mm in the st trial . in the second trial plastic type b stretch mm . plastic type a stretch the least in both trial . in the first trial plastic type a stretch mm and in the second trial it stretch mm . two wai that thi lab could have been improv would be to wait longer than minut to have them stretch and to make sure thei ar the same length .
3452	2	1	2	base on the student data plastic type d stretch the most which mean it is probabl made of weaker polym . plastic type a stretch the smallest amount which mean it is made of the strongest polym . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design or valid of the result ar to measur how thick in width each of the plastic strip were befor and after the experi and to describ the differ in textur if ani of each plastic .
3453	2	2	2	a plastic b stretch more than plastic a c d when weight ar ad to it . p . how much weight wa ad . . what do thei measur length in .
3454	2	1	0	a . from look at the data plastic type b in trial on and two seem to be the strongest when weight wa ad to them . p b . the student could have improv the experi by state what type of plastic thei were us for each . thei also could have been a littl more clear on some of their step .
3455	2	2	2	dure thi experi it wa proven that plastic sampl a wa the most durabl as it onli move between mm . the most flexibl howev wa plastic sampl b . it stretch between mm . to improv the valid of thi experi i would recommend specifi the amount of weight to add to the clamp . so that it can remain constant throughout the experi .
3456	2	3	3	type plastic b stretch the longest in t to t have measur of to . wai the student could improv their design ad measur of which to clamp weight and how heavi the weight ar .
3457	2	1	1	i a conclus base on the student data is that plastic d stretch the same amount at mm for trial trial . but plastic b stretch the most . for trial at mm for trial and mm for trial .
3458	2	1	1	in conclus plastic type d wa the most stretchabl stretch mm and a wa the least stretch mm . therefor type d would be the best choic . the design could be improv by ad a control and by ad the new much the weight were .
3459	2	0	0	a our hypothesi wa collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest becaus it is the most durabl . p b on wai to improv their design wa to add more to step seven like repeat step with new piec of plastic .
3460	2	3	3	a a conclus base on the student data is that plastic type b is the most stretchabl wherea type a is the least and is more resili . p b two wai to improv the valid includ ad a third becaus the data is differ in the first and a third would confirm accuraci a littl more . also contrast should be outlin such as keep the origin plastic sampl . the same size befor stretch specifi what ferment to go up by in weight ad and specif amount of weight to add must be the same .
3461	2	3	3	in the conclus of the experi plastic type b stretch the most to mm to mm . while i thought plastic type a stretch the least mm . two wai that these student can improv their experiment design would be have more variabl control such as how much weight to put on to the clamp . also the student got includ the start size of the plastic so it is hard to conclud ani of their data .
3462	2	1	1	a my conclus in thi experi would be that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl out of all the polym test . in both trial it had the most amount stretch trial it wa stretch mm and trial wa stretch mm . b the student could have improv the experiment design in two wai by have a control and by includ constant variabl . the control would serv as a refer point to the rest of the data and constant variabl would have made it so no other variabl were affect the result of the experi .
3463	2	3	3	i can conclud that plastic type b is the stretchiest becaus it stretch to and mm . p the student could specifi the amount of plastic that wa hang over the edg . the student could also sai how much weight he wa us .
3464	2	3	3	in conclus plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl while type a ha the lowest . on wai that the student could have improv the experi would be to have a specif weight such as b b b . anoth wai would be to add on more trial so as to prove or show better more valid result .
3465	2	2	2	on conclus that can be drawn is that plastic type b stretch the most mm and mm out of all the plastic . also plastic type a stretch the least onli stretch to mm and mm . thi is a conclus that can be drawn . p to improv the valid of the experi the student could name the four plastic us . also to have accur data the kid should have set a measur at which to cut all the plastic instead of sai measur it length . also ad a control would be help as well . thi is how the student could improv the valid of their experi .
3466	2	1	1	a conclus that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type d appear to be the most reliabl or stretch the most . two wai these student could have improv their design is thei could have done more trial and also thei could have kept ad weight and see where plastic broke first . and which held out the longest could have been the strongest .
3467	2	1	1	my conclus about the student data would be the farthest amount stretch he record on thing i would have done would be to chang the plastic to which is more durabl and add t so their can be more result .
3468	2	1	2	a base on the data plastic type b stretch the most dure trial and trial the least stretchabl plastic wa plastic type a . type c wa not veri stretchabl and plastic d wa the second most flexibl . p to ensur accuraci of the experi . p the student could have reveal the weight ad to each plastic in the tabl to make sure that it wa constant and also could have measur after a longer amount of time .
3469	2	1	2	a base on the student data and the trial . the experi seem to be veri valid and accur . p b on wai to improv thi experi i believ would be a third trial run onli becaus plastic type a wa mm awai from the first trial which doesn t give you a great conclus . and anoth wai i would chang thi would be explain better . it veri confus and not specif how much were the weight etc .
3470	2	2	2	if i look four plastic cup and tape them from the side of the tabl and place differ content such as weight . then the plastic cup will stretch . base on my result my hypothesi wa correct becaus trial and trial show that the plastic cup had stretch . for exampl plastic type a stretch mm in trial after ad weight to the clamp and let it hang for five minut . thei could have improv the thi experi by give the length of the cup befor the cup and then thei could have just measur it again and see what it wa after . for exampl befor after . thei also could of improv thi experi by do more trial to show the accuraci of the experi .
3471	2	2	2	base on the student data you can conclud that plastic b wa the stretchiest of all the plastic . if the student ar to conduct the experi again thei could improv their experiment design by us heavier weight and also do more trial .
3472	2	2	3	in conclus to thi data i think plastic type b is the most flexibl type of plastic . also plastic type a is the least flexibl . p the student can improv their experi by explain how much of each plastic thei should measur . for exampl step should sai take cm of on plastic type . also thei could improv it by ad the weight of the clamp and let it sit for longer than minut .
3473	2	1	1	after look at the data i can conclud that plastic wa d wa the stronger the plastic becaus it stai the same length . p b . two wai thei could have improv the job is by first state what type of plastic you ar us and by sai how much weight you have to the clamp .
3474	2	3	3	a from view data from me polym investig it show that plastic type b truli ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch the most out of all the polym at averag of . mm . p b the experiment design would have better if adopt a trial then the accuraci would go up . anoth thing that you could have done wa specifi how much weight your ad and if it the same amount for all plastic .
3475	2	1	1	i conclud that plastic type d didn t stretch all all becaus the mm length hasn t chang . on wai thei could have improv the experi is by tell us kind of plastic thei us . anoth wai is that thei could have told us how heavi the weight were that thei were us .
3476	2	0	0	in the conclus the plastic stretch out longest in t the t . p the wai thei could of make there experi better is by ad more weight everi lesion with the same time .
3477	2	2	2	accord to the student data plastic type b is the strongest . two wai the student could have improv the experi design valid of the result were . by state the length and type of each plastic . the student hover clarifi the length of each ban p of plastic . anoth thing the student should have done is state how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it wa the same each time .
3478	2	2	2	a conclus i draw base on their data is that plastic type d is the most durabl and strongest plastic . it didn t chang in either trial . an improv the student could have done made wa record the origin length of the plastic befor it went through the test . also thei could have record the amount of weight thei ad to the clamp in order to see what caus the plastic to stretch . valid of the result could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastic to hang .
3479	2	3	3	accord to the student data type b polym plastic stretch the furthest . the student could have improv thi experi by ad more trial and more sure that in step that all the plastic sampl were chang freeli down the side of the tabl evenli by measur the part tape .
3480	2	0	2	the weight and clamp and measur the length of the plastic .
3481	2	0	0	the student us differ plastic to determin it stretchabl . she took a sampl of on of the plastic measur she ad weight on the plastic to see how far it would on .
3482	2	3	3	a plastic b is more stretchabl than plastic a c and d . the student didn t mess up anywher dure the experi otherwis there would be a bigger gape on the st debil between two trial . p b the student should us the same amount of weight for each plastic and should have done a third trial .
3483	2	3	3	a a conclus i could come up with in thi experi is that plastic type b ha stretch mm which make it the most stretch but out of the thei test in both trial . while plastic type a had the least stretchabl at mm . b two wai the student could have improv thi experi is thei should have done at least or more trial to better the inform given . thei also should have made sure in step that each plastic wa hang off the tabl at the same length so it would be a fair wai to measur at the end .
3484	2	1	1	plastic type b ha the most stretchabl dure both trial . plastic type a had the least amount of stretchabl in both trial . the student could have explain how the plastic stai on the tabl if there were weight attach . also what kind of tabl the experi took place on .
3485	2	1	1	base on the student s data both plastic type a and b ha increas in t type c ha decreas in t and type d stai the same . p two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design is add more control and make more trial .
3486	2	2	2	in conclus scene within the data tabl plastic type b wa most durabl in be stretch . make plastic b have the most stretchabl . thi experi could of been improv by have a control of how far each plastic could be stretch with out weight secondli thei could have told us in the direct and in us smaller weight or larger weight and actual length size so the expir rent could be done right .
3487	2	1	1	on wai the student could have promis the experi is to try the trial more than onc .
3488	2	2	2	a base on the exploit data plastic type a stretch the farthest from trial to trial and plastic type b shriek from
3489	2	3	3	plastic
3490	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch the furthest out of the gap . p b give the specif name of the plastic us tell us what size weight to us .
3491	2	3	2	a conclus is that plastic type a is the strongest plastic becaus onc the weight wa taken off the plastic didn t stretch that much . p p a wai thei could have improv there experi is that thei could have said how heavier the weight were also thei could have made each plastic the same length befor ad weight .
3492	2	2	2	a base on the data plastic d had the greatest stretchabl with an over ag of mm stretch . thi wa much greater than plastic a which had the lowest averag amount stretch which wa mm . plastic b and c tell in the middl . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi design would to specifi the amount of weight us and make sure it wa the same each time . the student should also specifi how to hang the plastic off the tabl so that the same amount wa on the tabl as wa hang off .
3493	2	1	1	base on the student data i can conclud that the second time the trial wa done the amount that the plastic type stretch wa greater than that of trial on except for type c which it shrink mm from to in trial . two wai thei could have made thi experi better is if thei were specif on how much weight wa us and if in the chart thei includ the amount of time that each plastic type long .
3494	2	1	1	the first thing the student should improv the experi design is instead of attach clamp to the bottom of the plastic sampl thei should us small boot to it . then the second thing thei should is do more trial to the experi becaus thei probabl won t be happi with the data thei alreadi got so i would sai do more trial and thei might get better result .
3495	2	0	0	a conclus base on the data is that all the plastic type have rang around the same number . two wai the experi could have been approv is for the differ plastic type let the weight hold longer than five minut . and chang the trial .
3496	2	3	3	a . plastic b stretch the furthest and therefor had the most elast stretchabl . plastic a wa the least stretchi . these result were most like due to the combin of polym in each plastic control their physic attribut . p b . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design origin is by state how long the plastic should be cut to be . so to make the experi uniform . he should have increas thi in hi tabl so peopl could see how the length chang . then he should have specifi how much weight to add to the clamp for consist .
3497	2	3	3	a a conclus to the experi could be that plastic type b wa abl to be stretch the most mm mm when compar to the stretchabl of the after three plastic . p b . on wai the student could have improv the experi would be to add in the conclus the amount of weight thei add up to each tag . thei could have improv valid by ad anoth trial .
3498	2	2	2	from the student data you can tell that plastic type a ha the best stretchabl . plastic type b and c were the second best stretchabl . also that type d hold no sort of stretchabl but could have tri more time to yield better result or thei could have told us how much weight did thei put on for each clamp for each plastic .
3499	2	3	3	my experi conclud that out of the four plastic polym plastic type b wa the stretchiest while plastic type a wa the least stretchi . my hypothesi on how the plastic would stretch wa correct becaus i know that plastic type b immedi seem stretch than other plastic type . the student could have improv their experi by us a constant length for the plastic and us a contrast weight to stretch it with .
3500	2	2	2	a the conclus is that the plastic type b in the second trial stretch the most to mm . p b the could have ad a third trial and control variabl .
3501	2	2	2	look at the student s data you can see that plastic type b ha the best stretchabl . the bag stretch and mm that is more than ani other bag in the two trial . the student could have done on more trial to justifi their result . also thei could have us a differ amount of weight .
3502	2	1	1	after test four differ polym plastic . plastic type a b c . d for their stretchabl base on the data tabl plastic type a stretch mm and mm . t plastic b stretch mm t and mm . t plastic c stretch mm and mm t and plastic d stretch mm and mm t . show me that plastic b ha the most stretchabl and plastic a ha the least . two wai the student could have improv the experi wa includ a control to have someth to compar the stretchabl of the plastic to and state what each plastic wa .
3503	2	3	3	a my hypothesi that plastic type b would stretch the most wa correct . b stretch on averag . mm while the other three rang from mm . if i need a plastic with the largest stretchabl i would choos b . p b the experi would be more valid if i start with the same amount of each substanc befor do the trial and it would also be more valid if i complet on or two more trial .
3504	2	1	1	plastic b is the most stretchabl and a is the least stretchabl . p thei should vari the weight thei had on thi elop and also allow them to hen for longer .
3505	2	3	3	a accord to the student data . the conclus i can draw is that plastic b had the most stretchabl it stretch mm in trial on and mm in trial two second wa plastic d it s stretchabl wa mm for both trial and the least stretchabl wa plastic a with in trial on and in trial . b could have done more trial to compar data to and make trial to compar data to and make sure that each piec of differ plastic were the same size .
3506	2	2	2	base on the student data the plastic a stretch the least and the plastic type b stretch the most someth that could have the experi better is count how mani weight ar place on the clamp . thi experi is not valid becaus the number of weight isn t given . anoth thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not .
3507	2	0	0	a . with the student s data you can tell that trial aren t that much differ in the amount stretch . p b . two wai the student could have improv the result wa add less weight anoth thing is let it hang longer .
3508	2	2	2	the student could conclud that plastic b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch the farthest distanc everi time . the experi could have been improv by make all the origin piec of plastic the same length . also thei could have us a control for comparison .
3509	2	3	2	it ha come to my conclus that plastic letter b is the strongest . plastic b show that it ha the strongest by consecut stretch the most . p b first i would have don trial becaus that alwai render a more exact rat result than . second i would make sure all the plastic war the same length .
3510	2	2	2	a each trial wa veri close to the same answer as the other on so it move my valid and show that the weight doe stretch out the plastic . p b the student need to sai how long the plastic wa befor the experi . he should also have the weight of the weight list somewher .
3511	2	2	2	accord to the student data the conclus that plastic . type a stretch the most . the student could of improv the experi by make sure that all the plastic were the same length . anoth wai he she could of improv the experi is by do is third trial t everi experi that is be investig should have a third trail t in order to get the correct result .
3512	2	1	3	plastic type b and d stretch significantli father than a and c . thi allow us to infer thei have weaker bond make them more suscept to stretch . on wai the data would have been to write down the initi length of the plastic also record the initi weight . thi wai we have more inform to base our conclus off of .
3513	2	0	0	a when the experi wa finnish the data show that the four differ polym plastic for stretchabl didn t have differ result . the amount the four plastic type stretch in test on and test two were almost the same . p b two differ wai the student could have improv the experiment design and valid would of be ad time for the weight to work .
3514	2	1	1	the student data show that plastic type b hold the most weight and that plastic type a held the least . i think that the student would have ad more trial and record the averag of the trial . he also should have wait until the plastic boiler to record the data instead of wait for it to get to a certain length . anoth thing that could have been done is us less time . the student wait five minut befor ad anoth weight when thei could have just ad until the plastic rip .
3515	2	2	2	a the student can conclud that plastic type b stretch the most and plastic type b stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least . p b the student could have state what exactli he wa look for . he could have also ad anoth trial to see a better averag becaus some of them were close .
3516	2	2	2	base on the student s data it s safe to sai that plastic sampl a wa the strongest . you can see thi becaus in the chart the plastic wa the smallest . on thing the student could ve improv wa if all the plastic sampl were the same size . thi wai all the piec of plastic have the same start point . anoth thing the student could chang is take two sampl of each plastic so you weren t test the same sampl twice .
3517	2	3	3	a from the inform in the data tabl i can conclud that plastic type b stretch the greatest consid that and mm is the highest number compar to the rest . p b two wai the student could have improv the design ar measur the length of plastic befor the trial and do on more extra trial to check valid .
3518	2	2	1	out of both trial plastic type b got the longest after experi . it stretch out to mm in trial a and mm in trial b . plastic type a stretch out the least . in trial a it reach mm and in trial b it reach to mm . p two wai the student could have improv the valid of their result would be to add in the origin length of the plastic in their data tabl . thei could of also gave the name of the plastic instead of us letter .
3519	2	1	1	well in thi data i can conclud that the amount stretch from trial on ha increas when thei did the second trial but plastic d stood the same which wa at . p the student could have made thi experi better by tell us what type of plastic thei us . also thei could have said how much the weight weigh .
3520	2	1	1	a . plastic type d stretch the most and a stretch the least . p b . thei could have done a rd trial thei could explain what brand of plastic each type wa .
3521	2	1	2	a . base on the data from the experi the plastic that bell s the most wa plastic b in the first trial it expand min min in the second trial . b . thi experi is belong a control and need more trial to improv the valid .
3522	2	0	0	plastic type a had the most impact on stretch type b and c onli stretch out on mm longer type a wa the same . p the student could have ad more plastic type and let the weight clamp hang for a longer time .
3523	2	2	3	we can conclud that plastic b is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclud that plastic a can stretch the least . the student should haw us the same length plastic for each . the student should have also made their data tabl it show the plastic start length and end length .
3524	2	1	1	base on the student data i can draw a conclus that at the end of experi plastic type a stretch the longest with mm and type d stretch the least by remain the same at mm . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is first tell how much the weight weigh that he ad to the clamp . anoth wai the experiment design could have been improv is by tell what kind of plastic instead of us type a b c and d .
3525	2	2	2	a it is conclud that plastic type a had the most stretchabl becaus it increas mm in length from be stretch and all the other either grew smaller or bare stretch . p b two wai thi student could have improv the experiment design would be to have all the plastic begin length the same and also specifi how much weight to add to the plastic sampl .
3526	2	2	2	a base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type b had the highest amount of plastic stretch compar to the other . p b two wai student could of improv thi experi is by do materi to make result more reliabl . also thei should of had a control variabl of just the plastic so you can see the result on how far it ha stretch .
3527	2	3	3	base on the data collect by the experi plastic type b ha the greatest stretchabl when attach to weight . howev there ar wai in which thi experi could be improv . the student did not specifi how much weight or how mani weight were ad to the clamp . he she should write how mani weight thei us or even add trial where thei util differ amount . also a third trial should have been conduct to formul an averag stretchabl length . onli measur is not clear a third would allow the student to achiev an averag length for each plastic make the number more simpl to process .
3528	2	3	3	plastic type b ha more stretchabl then plastic a c or d . plastic b stretch on averag of . mm wherea a averag it c averag . and d averag . the student should have specifi the weight ad and us that weight each time . the student should also have start with the same size plastic and specifi that length .
3529	2	2	2	a a conclus base on the student s data is that between each trail the number stai the same or increas decreas by on . p p b two wai the experi could have improv is for the valid is to write down the mm it start at and anoth wai is to make sure when ad the weight thei ar the same found for each trail plastic type .
3530	2	2	1	accord to the data plastic type b had the most stretchabl of all them and plastic type a stretch the least each trial . the student could ve said what type of plastic it wa and also state the befor and after number for the plastic just in case there were ani error in the experi .
3531	2	3	3	base on these result i can conclud that plastic b ha the most stretchabl . these result ar valid becaus of the two trial so i can confid conclud thi . to improv the valid even more would be to us the same length plastic for each type becaus thi mai affect the result . also the should give a specif weight to add on the procedur instead of just sai add weight .
3532	2	2	2	the conclus of thi experi that plastic b is the stretchiest with and mm stretch in the two trial an averag of . mm plastic a wa the least stretchi with and mm stretch in the two trial an averag of mm . the student could have improv the experi by perform on trial t for the plastic to ensur valid . anoth wai could be to let the weight hang even longer or add more weight to each plastic to ensur valid .
3533	2	2	2	a . base on the data tabl the polym plastic with the most stretchabl is plastic type b becaus it wa stretch out the furthest then the next most stretchi wa d then c then the least wa a . p b . two wai to improv the experiment design or valid of the result ar be more specif how much weight is be ad to the plastic and for t i believ that a differ amount of weight should be ad to the plastic type .
3534	2	0	0	in conclus plastic a is the strongest and plastic d is the weakest . p the student could improv the valid of the result by sai in t t thei us differ set of kind of plastic . and you can also have at least on other person there to verifi thi .
3535	2	1	1	a from thi data you can conclud that . there realli wasnt much of a chang and that t bag is stronger . p b the student need an control and also need to be more specif . when it come to the weight .
3536	2	3	3	plastic sampl b stretch the farthest . p the experi could have been improv by ad exact amount of what to be ad on the plastic . also to measur how much of the plastic edg to be tape to the tabl so thei ar stand at the same point .
3537	2	1	1	repeat the procedur and us more exampl .
3538	2	0	0	to draw a conclus i would figur out the radium to thi data tabl . b two wai i think the student could of improv on thi data tabl would be to take step eight make sure thei re right .
3539	2	2	2	base on the student data it is conclus that plastic sampl a is the strongest plastic becaus in trial on it s length wa mm and in trial it s length wa mm . plastic b is the weakest plastic becaus it s length after weight were ad wa mm anton the second trial wa mm . p b the student could have improv the experi by increas the time from minut to minut and increas the number of trial with each sampl .
3540	2	2	2	the conclus i drew from the data is that plastic b and d most like have less rigid polym st mucou than a and c . the student could have improv the experi by do more trial and includ the exact weight of the weight to us . i think the experi is pretti valid becaus there ar no obviou error but the student could increas the valid by do more trial .
3541	2	2	2	base on the student result the polym plastic that wa abl to stretch the most wa plastic b . thi student could have improv the valid of the result by find out the averag of how far each plastic wa abl to stretch . he could have also note in hi procedur that all the weight most weigh the same so it could be constant . these chang would have made the experi better and make the result more valid .
3542	2	1	1	base on the data plastic type b is the most stretchabl polym . p the student could have improv valid by reduc the time in each trial us less weight .
3543	2	3	3	base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl of the four plastic becaus in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . on wai the student could have improv the valid of their result would be to do more trial . on wai thei could have improv the experiment design would be by specifi the amount of weight to place on the clamp in step .
3544	2	3	3	a the stretchiest polym plastic test wa type b follow by type c then type a be the least stretchiest p b the student could have . improv the experi by complet more trial to make conclus more valid . also the student could us a constant measur of how far off the tabl the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improv it by us a set amount of weight .
3545	2	2	2	base on the student data plastic type b wa stretch the most plastic type a wa stretch the last . i think two wai that could have made thi lab better is that all the plastic type should all have to be the same length befor you add the weight to them and second the procedur should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did .
3546	2	0	0	a thei should remain the same . p b thei should take out the weight . p c thei should work togeth on the project .
3547	2	2	2	two wai the student could have improv the experi on is too more trial . anoth is to let the clam hang for minut . p the conclus on for experi is that plastic type b is the weakest becaus it stretch the most and plastic a is the strongest .
3548	2	3	3	a plastic type b ha the most stretchabl becaus it stretch to and mm for both trial . plastic a c and d onli reach maximum length of or mm for both trial . p b the student could have improv their experiment design and or valid by ad more trial or by ensur that the same length of plastic hang on the side of the tabl .
3549	2	1	1	plastic type a stretch from to increas . plastic type b stretch from to increas . plastic c stretch from to decreas . plastic type d stai the same . p the student could have improv the experiment design by perform differ trial .
3550	2	2	1	it seem that plastic type b is the best . the reason why it wa the best wa becaus when it stretch it stretch for the longest . two chute i would mark would be more trial and more test plastic .
3551	2	1	2	the conclus is that the plastic b is the largest on in trial in trial . plastic b is the longest plastic out of all of the plastic style . the two wai to make experi would be ad more trial and also have the plastic weight hang for a longer time .
3552	2	2	3	a plastic type b had the most amount of stretch compar to the other . p b the student should have specifi the length becaus without a start length hi data is inconclus . the student also should have specifi to hold up or attach the clamp to someth so the end would be equal . in hi procedur it seem like you put weight on it while it hang loos .
3553	2	1	1	a . the conclus is that plastic type b had the most amount stretch in both trail and plastic type a had the least amount stretch in both trail . p b . on wai the student could have improv their experi would have to be tell what type of plastic thei us and anoth on would be to tell how long thei stretch each plastic .
3554	2	1	1	a plastic type a increas the more from the first trial to the second trial . it went from mm to mm . type c wa the onli type of plastic that decreas the length . type d stai the same at mm of length . p b the student could of had a control group which could of been a differ type of plastic . also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would chang the amount the plastic wa stretch from the first and second trial .
3555	2	2	2	a my conclus is if you add more weight the length of the polym would grow after minut . p b thei can improv by do more trial and by list differ polym thei were us . also thei can list who type of weight thei were us and how heavi those weight ar .
3556	2	2	2	a in conclus plastic type b could stretch the most . p the student could improv their experi by more trial and by stretch the plastic more .
3557	2	1	1	base on the student s data i conclud that for the second trial the plastic seem to have stretch slightli more than in the first trial . also for plastic type d the plastic length stai the same mean that it will not stretch ani further . p b two differ wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by ad more trial and more type of plastic to test .
3558	2	0	0	my conclus is that thei did a pretti good job set up the data tabl . thei not onli tri it onc thei tri it twice . on wai thei could of done a better job by instead of the data tabl thei shouldn t did a bar graph .
3559	2	1	1	a i conclud that the stretchabl of the plastic have no real differ becaus the stretchabl of the plastic onli veri by to millimet . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi is thei could have ad a specif amount of weight and thei could have let the weight stretch the plastic for a longer period of time .
3560	2	0	0	extend the time of the weight longer like about minut more . us differ materi .
3561	2	1	1	the conclus base on the student data is that plastic type d is the least stretchabl and type a is the most stretchabl . p to improv the experi the student should have add more trial and also test differ amount of weight so thei could see how each plastic type reach when even more weight wa put on .
3562	2	2	2	it would appear from the data that plastic type b is the most stretch abl of all the test plastic . it stretch on averag . more than the next stretch plastic . on wai to improv is sai what weight thei will appli to each plastic for exampl g g g . anoth wai is to us the same mass for all of plastic .
3563	2	1	1	a a conclus that can be made for thi experi is . in conclus plastic d would be the strongest type of plastic becaus accord to the data tabl in both trial plastic d did not stretch . p b two wai thi student could have improv these experi is by tell us the four differ type of plastic us also by tell us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measur in .
3564	2	1	1	plastic a and d were abl to withstand the most weight while b and c were the least . the student could have improv by us a control and do more trial for more accur test result .
3565	2	2	2	a . the purpos of thi lab is to test differ type of polym to see which polym is the stretchiest . base on the result found it can be conclud that plastic type b wa the stretchiest . in both trial on and trial plastic b stretch the most with mm in ti and mm in t plastic type a wa the least stretchabl with t and mm in t . p b . on wai the lab could be improv would to have specifi an exact width to us in the test . anoth possibl improv would be to test for longer amount of time . thi should show how the plastic stretch over a longer period of time .
3566	2	1	1	base on the student s data i conclud that the amount each plastic stretch had vari veri littl between trial . p two wai the student could have improv their experi would be . thei could have record the plastic sampl length befor thei stretch them . . thei could have and all the origin sampl to the same length the start them .
3567	2	1	1	i would sai that plastic type b is the most stretchabl type of plastic becaus in test and it doubl plastic type a and c .
3568	2	2	3	a plastic a stretch the least of all pour other plastic . therefor it is on of the strongest becaus it stretch less . p b on wai the student could have improv their experi is when repeat their experi start with a new piec of plastic . other wai thei can improv their experi is by ad the same amount of weight at each type . everi weight thei add should be the same .
3569	2	1	1	my conclus is that everi time you put weight on it it would stretch to a greater length . the wai i would improv it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommend and what is the best length to us .
3570	2	2	2	a conclus would be plastic type a is the vest stretch with t mm and t mm . also plastic type b had the most stretchabl at t mm m t . and type c d were c t mm t mm d t mm t mm . two wai the student could have improv wa to have a control with no weight on it . to improv and compar data . also us the same amount of weight for each plastic . to keep data acut .
3571	2	3	3	the conclus for thi experi is the plastic the trial the most stretchabl in trial the amount stretch wa mm . in trial the amount stretch wa mm . wai the student could have improv the experi design or valid of the result is to includ the length befor it wa stretch and keep the amount of height constant .
3572	2	2	3	a . base on the student data the conclus i draw wa that plastic b had the greatest stretchabl . p b . on wai that thi student could have improv thi experi is to add more trial to have more data to trial conclus with anoth wai the student could have improv the experi wa .
3573	2	1	2	a i conclud that plastic type b ha the best stretchabl and plastic type a ha the worst type b had and while type d had and mm stretchiest . p b the student could improv their experi if thei record how mani clamp thei ad befor the plastic brake . the student also could have record the time the plastic brake at .
3574	2	3	3	a polym plastic b s the stretchiest polym plastic . p b the student can verifi that the length of all the plastic ar the same at the begin of the experi to keep sampl constant and he can verifi the weight of the weight and clamp to keep variabl constant as well .
3575	2	1	1	a . the conclus would be that the procedur of thi student data had went as plan . all of the result all were around the same number and some were the same . p b two wai the student could have improv on thi experi is to have a control group and also thei could of had a third trial to make sure that the result were all correct .
3576	2	2	2	the west flexibl type of plastic wa type b . on the first trial type b stretch mm while type a hand the least flexibl by onli stretch mm . also type d wa the deacon stretchiest plastic but it did not struck on trial . on wai that ye student could ve improv the experi deal wa by sai how much weight to put on the plastic . their result code be in been better by get new plastic to stretch .
3577	2	0	0	a from look at the student s data from their experi trial had better result than trial . in trial thei could have done the produc more like the instruct tell them to instead of do half . p b i do not see anyth that thei could have done differ .
3578	2	2	1	a plastic type a ha the highest level of stretchabl becaus from the st and the second trial it stretch mm while the other plastic type onli stretch mm or stai the same . p b two wai the student could improv the experi could have been to add more weight to the bag . anoth wai to improv the valid of the result is to specifi how heavi the weight were and how mani did he put .
3579	2	2	2	plastic type a stretch the least onli mm thu make it the strongest while plastic type b stretch the most mm thu make it the weakest . could have let the weight hang there for more than minut to increas valid and had more trial to increas valid .
3580	2	1	1	a accord to the conclus plastic type a length stretch more than the rest of the plastic . plastic a is the most stretchi . p b the student could had ad more trial and a can and group .
3581	2	3	3	from the student s experi i can conclud that plastic type b wa abl to stretch the most while plastic type a stretch the least . howev these student need to improv their experiment design . two wai that is possibl would be to give definit and constant stretch result for each sampl as well as defin how much weight should be us and where the clamp should be place exactli . thi would definit improv the valid of their result .
3582	2	2	1	plastic type b is the strongest plastic to us . it wa the strongest for both trial and for trial . the student could have done on more trial to make the inform a littl more valid . also the student could have let the weight hang longer than minut .
3583	2	1	1	a plastic d stretch the same length in both that but plastic type a is the stretchiest . b thei could have done more that and the should have us differ weight for more result .
3584	2	2	2	plastic type b stretch the most in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . plastic type b stretch the same length in t and t mm . type c stretch mm in t but in t stretch onli mm . type a stretch the leas in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch in mm . the student can add more more time for the weight to hang . the student can also add a third trial to see witch if type c will remain to strength and less .
3585	2	1	1	a base on the data given in the second trial the plastic stretch more than the first . also plastic type b and d stretch the most in both trial . p b two wai the student could have improv their experiment design would be more specif with the procedur and try more trial to averag out the result .
3586	2	2	3	a in conclus plastic type b wa the strongest becaus it stretch the longest plastic a stretch mm and mm . plastic b mm and mm and plastic c mm and mm and plastic d mm and mm . thi data state that plastic b wa the strongest . b on wai he could have improv the experi is by have all the plastic equal in size and also he could have ad the same amount of weight .
3587	2	0	0	trial d ha better perform better .
3588	2	1	1	a in contend the data record show that plastic type d stretch the same amount in each trial . p b the student could have done a third trial thei could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time .
3589	2	0	0	my conclus is that t had a better amount stretch than t had . also t had more plastic type than t .
3590	2	3	3	plastic type b stretch the farthest . the student could have improv the experi by do a third trial and by specifi how much weight to add to the clamp .
3591	2	0	0	a . plastic type d is the p
3592	2	1	2	my conclus for thi experi is that if plastic b is us than it will be abl to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weight . the reason i know thi is becaus in trial and it had the lead length . a wai that thi experi could have been improv would be by not put the weight on at the same time . thi would allow for the bag to get us to each weight . anoth thing could be to make sure all the plastic ar equal in measur becaus that can ruin the data .
3593	2	0	1	a repeat the experi t s measur increas success than t by not chang the variabl and repeat the experi eight time . show how the wight of the weight affect thoroughli . p b the student could improv the experi design by increas the weight or the weight and us differ type which usual be the depend variabl .
3594	2	2	2	as a conclus base on the data plastic type b wa the more stretchabl plastic . in trial plastic type b stretch mm in trial plastic type stretch mm . therefor plastic type b ha a high stretchabl level . b two differ wai the student could have improv . p the student could have state how much the weight weigh and how mani to make the experi more vigor . p the student could have indic the trial high becaus some bag take longer to stretch or and break .
3595	2	2	2	a my conclus is that polym plastic b had the most stretchabl . p b two wai the experi could have been improv would be . p allow the bag to stretch until thei break and record the maximum length each stretch to . p the student could have specifi the weight us .
3596	2	1	3	accord to the student data i would conclud that plastic b wa the most stretchi compar to the other plastic . the student could of ad the weight in the same exact order and made sure she measur in the same measur .
3597	2	2	2	a i conclud that plastic type b stretch the most becaus in the trial it stretch mm and in the second mm . plastic type a stretch the least becaus it onli stretch mm in the first and mm in the second trial . p b the student could have improv their experi in sever wai . first off that could have identifi a specif amount of weight to add on to the clamp . thei could have also includ a control .
3598	2	2	3	a on conclus i observ base on the student s data is that plastic type b is the most stretchabl of the . p b two wai the experiment design could have been improv ar if the student describ the amount of weight put the bag and the student could have done the trial again us more time .
3599	2	3	3	a in conclus the plastic type that stretch the most wa plastic b . p b two wai that the student could of improv hi or her investig is by sai how mani weight will thei student put and how much doe it weigh . also describ how long the plastic type were befor she start her experi .
3600	2	0	0	a my conclus is that the second trial went better than the first becaus the number ar much larger than the first . p b the first wai is the student could have been more specif on what thei did . and the seven wai is thei should have said what type of plastic and tape thei wa us .
3601	2	1	1	a trial wa the on with the most stretchabl . trial wa around the trial s number but trial wa a ting but tiger or stai the same . plastic c actual decreas on . p b thei should have try eden ic plastic more trial to see it most would increas or decreas .
3602	2	3	3	a . in conclus some of the plastic stretch more than other howev all of them did stretch . polym a stretch the least and polym b stretch the most . from the result it can be assum that all polym stretch . p the student need to specifi how much weight is ad and what the start and end measur of each plastic were .
3603	2	0	0	the conclus of thi lab show that in the first trial the plastic wa stretch mm . trial two it wa stretch mm . surprisingli in the third trial it actual got smaller by mm . also the last trial it stai the same length . two improv could have been how the student should have made the weight heavier and should have made a clearer data tabl .
3604	2	1	2	the student can conclud plastic type a is least stretchabl and plastic type b is the most stretchabl and will be less like to break . the student could have improv the experiment design by tell us what thei origin measur the plastic in it cm in . e . t . c told us how mani weight and how much thei weigh and the type of tape that tap the plastic in the tabl .
3605	2	0	0	the conclus base on the student s data is that with trial and with trial there were some chang happen the amount of plastic stretch more the second trial than the first . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is in what minut did the stretch begin and what plastic wa the strongest .
3606	2	2	2	base on the data it can be conclud that plastic a is the least stretchabl and plastic b is the most . plastic a stretch mm and mm in both trial which wa the smallest length . plastic b stretch mm and mm which wa the largest length after five minut . the student could have improv their experi and their result by us plastic sampl of the same length and by allow the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time .
3607	2	1	1	plastic a wa obvious the most suscept to stretch becaus it stretch inch while plastic b onli stretch plastic d did not stretch at all and plastic c lost an inch . thi experi would be more valid if the procedur said how much weight to add to the plastic so that it wa known what it take to stretch it and how the plastic wa be measur . although the data tabl sai that the procedur doe not .
3608	2	0	0	the conclus i have drawn is that plastic type d both trial stretch the same amount also that t wa better . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result is by compar their trial to differ plastic and collect that data .
3609	2	2	2	a . base on the student data plastic type b had more stretchabl than the other . p b . the student could have done more trial or ad on more time for the plastic to stretch longer .
3610	2	3	3	a plastic type b wa the most stretchi and stretch the longest dure the given time . p b the wai the student could of improv wa thei could of conduct more trial to improv the valid of the result also in their procedur thei could of said to make sure each polym plastic wa measur out befor the experi so thei all start at the same length .
3611	2	3	3	plastic b proven by the result is the most stretchabl of the four plastic . due to it stretch mm on the first trial and mm on the second trial it averag amount stretch to . mm make it mm stretchier the the runner up plastic . p on wai thei could have improv the design of the experi is by make sure all the plastic us had the same initi length . also to tell how much the weight of the clamp weigh to be abl to re conduct the experi to do more trial .
3612	2	0	1	a the plastic that stretch wa b t and the least wa a t . p b the wai the student could of improv thi expir men is by when thei put tape on top of the edg of the plastic sampl to a tabl well thei should of left put weight on th plastic to see how much it hold .
3613	2	3	2	a base on the student data i can draw the conclus that plastic type b had the most stretchabl . if you you peter back to the graph in trial plastic b wa and in trial it wa which wa more than ani of the other plastic . b on wai in which the student could have improv the experiment design is by ad anoth trial . thei could also have told you how long the type of plastic wa to begin with in the first place therefor increas the valid and accuraci of the experi .
3614	2	1	1	student will wrap up an conclus after plastic type the amount it stretch is done . the whole experi wa base on how far each plastic stretch and which on stretch the first and also the on which ed stretch the least . p thei could have improv it by stretch each plastic three separ trial and the answer would have been more clear .
3615	2	1	0	two wai that the student could have improv the experi design or valid of the result is by increas the amount of time thei stretch the plastic and the plastic type could get chang .
3616	2	0	0	a plastic b seem to be the most durabl becaus in it stretch mm in t it stretch mm and the least durabl seem to be plastic a becaus in t onli stretch mm and in t it stretch mm b thei could have specifi the type of plastic and long in second wa the plastic be stretch .
3617	2	2	2	a from the data i am abl to conclud that plastic type b is the most durabl . it length stretch to be and . thi show that it wa abl to hold the heaviest amount of weight b on wai the student could improv the experiment design is by us same weight for each plastic . also the student should us the same measur just so thei can be reassur that the length of the plastic is accur for each of the plastic .
3618	2	1	0	the conclus is that the plastic did stretch out but some stai the same length and other decreas . p the student would have improv is by have a control group by do it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there ani differ in ti stretchabl .
3619	2	0	0	of the four type of plastic a and c stretch about the same amount of weight and d stretch about the same amount . the first wai thei could improv the experi would be to test differ amount of weight . thei should also onli measur what hang over the tabl both time for a more precis result .
3620	2	3	3	a to conclud plastic type b is the most stretchabl out of all four type of plastic . type b stretch mm on t and mm on t averag of . mm while type a and c rang between mm and mm and type d mm . type a wa the most stretch resist so thi type of plastic would be the best for groceri bag so that food doesn t fall out . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by includ how much the weight attach to the clamp on the plastic weigh and how long the plastic should be for each type . should it be the same or differ .
3621	2	3	3	base upon the given data i can conclud that plastic b had the most stretchabl . the first thing the student need to fix is in hi experiment design in step s he sai to add weight . . . but thei don t specifi how much weight to add . the next thing that need to be fix deal with valid . the student need to record the start length of each plastic as well as keep their length constant . p sai eat amount of weight to add record start length of plastic .
3622	2	3	3	a . base on the student data plastic b wa abl to be stretch the most it wa stretch mm the first time and the second . p b first the student should have state how much weight to add to the clamp and measur how much the clamp weigh . to get the total weight ad would ve improv valid . also the student should have made the plastic sampl all the same length so that thei start from the same point .
3623	2	1	0	i predict accord to thi experi that the student could improv their experi by try on more time find out the control find out the variabl find out the independ variabl depend variabl . do a hypothesi conclus that s what i think the student have to do to valid the result of the experi .
3624	2	3	2	a base on the student data on can conclud that plastic type b had the most stretchabl . for both trial perform type b stretch the furthest at mm mm . therefor thi type of plastic is probabl the most durabl of the becaus it wa abl to withstand such stretch . p b the student could have improv by specifi what type of plastic to us instead of just a b c or d . also by specifi how far from the edg of the tabl each piec of plastic need to be tape as thi can effect result if thei ar not all the same length .
3625	2	2	2	. a base on the data given plastic b stitch for nest . p b the student could have written the start length of the plastic . he also cook have put hi reason for do the experi .
3626	2	2	2	my conclus is that plastic type a can stretch the least becaus not onli did it not stretch anymor in t it actual got mm shorter . plastic type a is the best becaus it can stretch the most . it stretch mm more in t . p b on wai the student could have improv hi her experiment design and or valid of the result is to includ the data on what the plastic measur befor he ad weight . he could have also includ the weight of the weight he ad .
3627	2	0	0	a the amount stretch by t show more improv by have it stretch becaus the differ materi . both were investig at the same time . on place wa more affect . p b on wai is is by mayb leav it a littl longer . or us differ type of weight .
3628	2	3	3	base on the student data we can conclud that plastic b ha the most stretchabl compar to plastic ac or d . in trial plastic type b stretch mm and mm in trial . all of the other plastic stretch less than thi amount . for exampl plastic a onli stretch mm for trial . wai thi experi can be improv can be do to even more trial in order to verifi result even greater . thei also can specifi the size of the plastic and keep it constant . the length of each plastic show the same . if the plastic ar of differ size then the result could be affect . also the student could have also specifi how much like weight is and us the same amount of weight for each on . if on plastic had kg on it and anoth kg then the on with kg mai stretch farther not becaus it ha more stretchabl but becaus it wa held by more weight . thi is how thei could improv .
3629	2	0	0	a in conclus the amount stretch t stretch a littl bit more than t by mm . i show that t can stretch more than t . p b . on wai thei can improv by wait a littl longer the five minut and second wai is that thei should of us three kind of differ plastic .
3630	2	2	2	a . from the result of the experi you can see that plastic type b ha the highest amount of stretchabl while plastic type a ha the lowest amount of stretchabl . p b . the student should us the same amount of weight for each plastic . and add a control to the experi to improv the experi .
3631	2	2	2	base on the student data plastic a and b both stretch mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretch the most in trial and is plastic b . p the student could of improv thi experi by ad the weight but with a certain amount of weight that wa us the same on each plastic and trial . also the student should have stretch each sampl as far as it would go .
3632	2	1	2	a the data show that trial two wa more effici than trial on becaus thei all increas other than on plastic type . i can also conclud that the plastic type that stretch the most wa plastic b . p b two wai the student could have improv there experi ar . let it hang for longer than five minut and . perform more trial .
3633	2	0	0	a my conclus on the experi is that plastic type d ha the longest mm stretch out . b the student have put the plastic on a hang string wa a steami boil pot of water . then the student could have record more valid and improv data on a chart .
3634	2	2	2	by the out come of thi experi you can tell that plastic b is the stretchiest . two thing that could have been done to improv the experi ar make sure how long the plastic should be in the begin and if all the plastic type should be the same length befor you tape them .
3635	2	2	2	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic type a and b stretch more in the second trial than in the first trial . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and the valid of the result ar that he should have written the begin measur of each piec of plastic and he should have test each piec three time not just two .
3636	2	1	1	the two wai that the student could have improv on thi experiment design is on what kind of plastic where thei us and name each on . the second would be what would you measur the plastic . what type of measur stick you would us or a tripl been balanc . also thei could have dawn three trial to make there experi valid .
3637	2	1	2	a base on the result i can conclud that plastic type b and r had a similar stretchabl becaus thei increas by mm . type c and d ar not as stretchabl becaus type actual decreas by mm after trial and type d stai the same . p b the student should have told us much each weight and how mani will go on the plastic type .
3638	2	3	3	a plastic type b can stretch the most while a ha the most tensil strength becaus it stretch the least . p b the student could have improv their design by have the plastic be the same length for each plastic . for exampl each could be a foot long . a second chang would be to put the same amount on each plastic for exampl each could have a lag weight .
3639	2	0	1	in conclus after do thi experi i came to the conclus that the plastic type by wa the on with the longest length of the plastic type . it had mm in the first trial and it had mm in the second trial . p the student could ve wait more than minut to measur the length .
3640	2	1	1	my conclus would be that plastic type d would be the most stretch becaus it went up to mm with out tear . two wai student could have make the experi by on cut a determin length for all four plastic and record the time it took to stretch .
3641	2	2	2	a . a conclus i can draw from thi is that plastic type a had stretch mm the first trial and mm in the second trial make it the most stretchabl plastic type . p b . i think that thi student should have done at least trial . i think thi student should have not tape the plastic at the top of the tabl he should have done it over a bar so both side could be test .
3642	2	3	3	a the plastic that ha the most stretchabl is plastic type b a stretch of mm in the first trial and in the mm in the second trial . plastic type a ha the worst stretchabl . stretch mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . p b thei should have state and us the same amount of weight for each trial . thei also should have us the same amount of each plastic .
3643	2	1	1	a . base on the student s data the amount of stretchabl in each spastic type wa differ for trial and . with an except of type d that remain the same . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar to clarifi the weight of the weight thei ad on step then for step thei should have had clarifi the procedur that had to be repeat ex repeat step exactli for other three plastic plastic sampl .
3644	2	1	1	a i see that the amount stretch of plastic a b increas on the second trial but the amount stretch of plastic a decreas and the amount stretch for plastic d remain the same . p b the student could have make a third trial to see what the outcom would be . the student could have made the trial for anoth period of time so instead of five mr and he doe ten minut for each of them .
3645	2	2	1	a base on the student trial i have come to conclus that plastic b wa abl to stretch more than a c d witch make it more resist then the rest . p b the student could of group thi experi on each experi to see how much it could chang and thei could of also made a graph to show the result .
3646	2	1	1	a . to conclud the polym plastic went through four trial . the data show that a wa averag to b wa averag to . c wa averag to . and d stai at . the plastic type b stretch to most . i predict that if thei did a rd trial the number would be close . p b . the student could of improv if thei let the plastic hang for minut and mayb the result wouldn t be so close . also add more detail to the procedur .
3647	2	2	3	a in conclus plastic type a stretch mm more in the second than in the first trial . plastic type b stretch mm more in the second trial than in the first . plastic type c stretch mm more in the second trial than in the first trial . plastic type d stretch the same amount in both trial . p b to improv the valid the group could have state how much weight to us and had more test and trial .
3648	2	1	1	student could have made hi or her own hypothesi to test . also should have the procedur more than time .
3649	2	2	1	base on the data b wa the most stretchabl polym follow by d c and lastli a . seriou sourc of error need fix . for on the initi length of plastic wa not held constant make all data most . also allow the plastic to stretch until break . would truli test thi properti . howev as the result ar consist between trial the result seem valid .
3650	2	3	3	a base on the student data plastic type b stretch the most . all of the bag stretch onli around to mm differ in both trial compar to their first . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result wa to show the length befor thei were stretch and show the amount of weight ad onto the clamp .
3651	2	2	2	the plastic that stretch the most in both trial wa plastic type b . it stretch mm and the second trial it stretch mm . that show it ha the most durabl for stretch . p the student should have put down the measur thei chose to start the plastic at . thei should have also includ the time on the data tabl . thei should have done variou trial to the e experi .
3652	2	0	0	thei could take note and make a bar graph and put all of it togeth and come out with the answer . p thei could us a weight and find out how much the weight by it self .
3653	2	0	0	by the process or do it the graph show me that the amount of stretch of t and t didn t chang both plastic had the same stretch . and it would chang by ad more weight becaus the plastic wouldn t be visibl as the other on .
3654	2	1	1	a accord to my conclus b wa the on who got stretch the longest and a wa the shorter on . b on wai thei could do thi to make it better is by us differ plastic type or by duck tape the plastic to a cup and start put weigh until it break .
3655	2	2	2	for plastic type a the amount stretch increas by on mm . for plastic type d the amount stretch for trial on and two were the same . with plastic c the result decreas by on mm . the student could improv their result by repeat more trial . thei also didn t mention the measur the plastic be origin .
3656	2	0	0	the conclus is most student plastic stretch more then other . thei could improv the experi by leaven the clip minut .
3657	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch the most than d then c then a . the second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more besid plastic c plastic c didn t increas it s stretch in trial to actual in trial it stretch more than in trial .
3658	2	1	2	a plastic type b is the the most elast plastic and type a is the least elast plastic howev all plastic type ar elast . p b the student could have includ a specif weight to us and thei could have provid elast type .
3659	2	3	3	a i would conclud that plastic a is the strangest becaus it didn t stretch as much as plastic b c or d . p b on thing the student s could have done to improv their experi is includ exactli how much weight thei put on each clamp so it could easi repeat and easier to understand . anoth thing thei can do is do a third trial for more accur result .
3660	2	2	2	a plastic b is the most flexibl of the plastic type . p b the valid should be improv if the student specifi how much weight wa ad to the clamp . also specifi how high up the tabl wa .
3661	2	2	2	plastic b happen to stretch the further in trial . the student could have us more plastic . also the student could have us more trial that would have shown the accuraci .
3662	2	1	1	a in conclus the student s data that wa record show plastic type b capabl of stretch the most than d than c plastic type a stretch the least . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi design valid of the result would be by learn a hypothesi . anoth thing that could be an improv is if thei vari the time the plastic hang for up the amount of weight for each type .
3663	2	3	3	a base on the student data plastic b is the most stretchabl . plastic b stretch an averag of . mm while the next most stretch plastic wa d with an averag of mm . p b to improv valid design the student could have conduct more trial . the student also should have specifi exactli how heavi the weight us ar so that the experi is regrett .
3664	2	2	2	a the more weight us the more the plastic stretch . p b thei should ve us someth more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the tabl and specifi if all the plastic piec ar the same length and did therefor thei start experi on them . thei should also sai how much weight thei ar ad on at a time and how log you wait befor ad on more weight .
3665	2	3	3	by the result of the student s investig thei have conclud that plastic type b is the stretchiest polym of all four and plastic type a is the least stretchiest polym . p three wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by start off with each polym with the same length . the same amount of weight for each polym and repeat the experi time instead of .
3666	2	1	1	a we can conclud that plastic type b is stronger becaus on the best trial i onli stretch by mm . then on the second trial it decreas to stretch by more . pictur type a is strong but on the first trial it stretch mm while on the second trial it stretch mm more . we would rather have the stretch decreas than increas . b the student could have ad more time to the bag be stretch and thei could have done more trial .
3667	2	2	2	. a in conclus plastic sampl b stretch the most when test for stretchabl . it stretch nearli twice as much as sampl a c but sampl d wa close in amount . p b the first wai the student could improv their experi is to specifi in how mani weight thei attach and make sure all the weight weigh the same . thei also could have been more specif about the clamp so thei can have a control and noth could effect the valid of the result .
3668	2	3	3	there is not enough data to draw a conclus from the student data the student never told us what the start length of the polym plastic where and thei never told us how much the weight weigh .
3669	2	0	0	for the name of color the plastic .
3670	2	2	2	to conclud the polym investig accord to data plastic a is the stretchiest . plastic d is the least stretchi . p two wai the student could have improv thi experi is by . tell us how long the plastic measur befor it wa stretch anoth wai is by . how much did the weight weigh
3671	2	3	3	base on the student data it show that plastic type a had the highest stretch constanc to the weight pull on it . in the two trial it onli stretch and mm while the next best stretch and . on wai to improv their experi is to have perform a third trial . although their test two were similar to end result the third trial would onli have made it more valid definit prove their result ar correct . anoth wai is to specifi how heavi the weight ar and what type of plastic is be us . then the reader would know exactli what you re do in the experi and it d give a better understand .
3672	2	2	3	a a conclus drawn from thi experi would be that plastic type b ha the most flexibl . b on wai to improv the experi would be to make sure each plastic get weight in the same place . anoth step would be to make sure the clamp wa on the same place on each plastic so the experi is more valid .
3673	2	2	3	base on the student data plastic type b in trial and stretch the most and have the most stretchabl . p on wai the student could improv thi is by us the same weight for each bag and trial . anoth wai is by us the same clamp type so it s the same weight ad from it each time .
3674	2	2	2	a conclus that can be reach base on the student s data would be that the best plastic type to us to prevent breakag of a bag would be type d . it wa not stretch at all when the weight were ad . on wai to improv the valid of thi experi would be to conduct more trial and the averag not the result . thi would ensur which plastic is the strongest . anoth wai to improv valid would be to specifi the weight us and know it as a control for each plastic type . these two thing must be done to ensur valid .
3675	2	2	2	base on the data i can conclud that the plastic stretch more in the second trial compar to the first trial . also i can conclud that plastic b stretch the most becaus it held the most weight . on wai the student can improv the experiment design is to includ exactli what plastic thei ar us . anoth wai the could improv their experiment design is to includ what thei ar us as weight french plastic .
3676	2	1	1	a . the plastic type b ha the most stretchabl becaus in both trial it had a larg length . p b the student could improv the valid of the result by make sure he kept the same time limit . also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releas the weight .
3677	2	0	0	the student could of label the chart better than the did . the could have on add more info to the procedur and state why thei ar do thi experi for .
3678	2	2	1	a that depend on the plastic type depend weather the plastic stretch or not and how much . p b on wai put the first length then the second on the chart anoth wai titl the plastic type .
3679	2	1	1	plastic type a stretch longer than the other plastic type . the student could improv the experi by put the name of plastic . and add anoth trial . trial ar alwai best .
3680	2	2	2	a i conclud that trial on and two have similar number so plastic b and d ar the stretchiest . p b on wai the student could have improv on the valid of the experi is by us someth better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and grand of tape . anoth wai thi experi would be better is if i length the weight that tore the plastic .
3681	2	2	2	plastic type b ha the greatest elast while plastic type a ha lowest . the student could improv valid by have more trial and record start mm .
3682	2	1	1	conclus the student got their inform base on the test result which seem pretti reason . p b two wai the student could have improv their experi wa have a control and have more trial .
3683	2	0	0	a . plastic a and b and c ar more stretch resist than plastic b and d . also plastic b stretch the most with mm the first trial and mm the second trial . p b . on wai thei could of told us the in of and the constant of the lab like why thei ar do it .
3684	2	1	1	in the end trial of the experi had stretch a coupl mm longer a part from plastic d than trial . thi experi can be improv by keep the weight on for minut longer to give a better result . anoth wai it can be improv is do on more trial to get more result to compar for the lost mass to improv it is ad anoth plastic type to provid a varieti of plastic .
3685	2	3	3	base on the data we can conclud that plastic type b is the stretchiest sinc it stretch the most in both trial . p keep the same length of the plastic of a constant and specifi length . repeat trial again rd time .
3686	2	2	2	a the strongest plastic wa c . p b thei should have record the length of the plastic piec and ad it to the data tabl befor test and thei could have ad anoth test and us more weight .
3687	2	1	1	plastic type d wa the most stretch out of all of the other plastic . the student need to repeat the step for a rd time also . the student should not have us the same plastic over thei should have gotten a new place do the result would show valid to result .
3688	2	3	3	base on the student s result the plastic with the most stretchabl is plastic b . both trial it had the highest length . it beat plastic d by and mm . p two wai the student could have improv the experi is by repeat the experi at least on more time . it help the valid of the experi . anoth wai he she could have improv is by have a certain length and shape for the variou plastic .
3689	2	3	2	plastic type b is the stretchiest type of the plastic type thi student test . p b the student could ve specifi how mani weight to add and how much each weight weigh .
3690	2	3	3	plastic type b is the most stretchabl plastic out of the other four . the student could have ensur that all the plastic ar the same length befor thei begin the experi . thei could have also ad specif amount of weight rather than simpli ad a random amount . thi would have made the experi more conclus .
3691	2	1	1	a the plastic wa stretch but not a lot at the most it wa stretch two inch . p b thei could have said how heavi the weight were also state what type or brand of plastic is be us .
3692	2	2	2	in conclus the experi ha even led that the four differ polym plastic neither stretch veri far each trial or didn t stretch veri far at all . p two wai the student could have improv the experi design and or valid of the result ar give us the start measur and do the trial a third time to see if the result chang or show the same .
3693	2	3	3	the valid of the data is question but on conclus is that plastic a wa the strongest becaus it stretch the least . p two thing the student could have done to improv hi experiment design valid of hi result ar data certain long
3694	2	3	3	a out of all plastic type b wa the most stretchabl for both trial d wa the second most stretchabl c the third and a wa the least to improv the experiment design the student should have specifi the length of the plastic and made sure thei were all the same continu and accuraci of the result . anoth thing that should have been done is the mass of the weight should have been includ and it should have been specifi that thei were all the same to again ensur accur result .
3695	2	1	1	. for the conclus the student could of put what kind of plastic thei us . also thei could made the data tabl a littl more detail . p the student could have improv their experi by beam some of the plastic also thei could of put the size of the weight .
3696	2	0	0	plastic type d stai the same . thei should had left more minut to hang .
3697	2	2	2	a from the student data tabl i came to a conclus that plastic b is more stretchabl . p b thei could have done more trial and try other plastic .
3698	2	2	2	a plastic type b ha the most stretchabl and plastic type a ha the least stretchabl . p b the student could have told how much weight thei put on the plastic . thei could of also explain how plastic type becom smaller .
3699	2	1	1	base on the student data plastic type d had the most stretchabl it stretch mm n t and stretch the same in t . while a stretch mm and b stretch mm and c went from mm on t and drop to mm on t . p the wai the student could ve improv the experiment design is by tell us how much weight thei us and add more weight .
3700	2	0	0	a plastic d length did not increas or decreas in both trial . p b on wai student p could have improv the experiment design by let it hang for more time to see how it wa affect when it stretch . sinc their result in both trial were close thei should ve test it versu anoth .
3701	2	1	0	a in conclus t stretch a lot more than t . thei were try to investig witch kind of plastic stretch more . p b two wai the student could of improv their design wa explain clearli what thei were do and why in their procedur . also mayb thei should of did a t to repli test it becaus if it wa differ in t and t then thei definit dont have a final answer .
3702	2	2	2	in conclus the type of polym doe affect it abil to stretch becaus plastic type a b inde did stretch by at least mm . howev plastic type c d either got smaller shrunken or did neither stretch nor decreas but remain the same . p two wai thi design could have been improv would be to have an equal amount of weight place on all clamp and do more than trial .
3703	2	3	3	a base on the student s data polym plastic type b wa the most stretchabl and polym plastic type a wa the most resist to stretch or the strongest . type b stretch an averag of . mm while type a stretch onli an averag of mm and type c and d came in the middl stretch averag of . mm and mm . type a had the strongest polym in the plastic and type b had the weakest . p b . the first improv could have been to includ control by test the stretchabl of the materi or plastic without polym or run trial on the same plastic without ad weight to have a valid comparison to see if the polym ar actual what ar affect their stretchabl . the second improv could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thick as that can affect stretchabl . thei could also us more precis instrument or run more trial .
3704	2	3	3	a . plastic type a is stronger and stretch less slowest then c d and b . p b . make each plastic the same start length and the weight ar the same weight .
3705	2	3	3	as a conclus to the data shown on the tabl plastic b had the most stretchabl . accord to the data collect the inform is reliabl becaus the amount stretch in t wasn t too differ than t . the student could ve made the experi more reliabl by specifi the exact length of each plastic to start with and made them all the same . also the student should ve been exact about the weight and made sure it wa the same for all of them .
3706	2	2	2	plastic type a stretch the least follow by type c and d leav b to be the stretchiest plastic type . two wai the student could have improv the experi would be to test at differ time period and to specifi the amount of weight is be ad to the clamp .
3707	2	2	3	a plastic b is the most elast becaus it had the highest averag amount stretch at . mm . type a wa the least stretchabl at an averag of mm . p b the student have given a specif amount for the weight to be us . in addit the amount to be off the tabl should be given becaus the amount hang off affect how far it will stretch p and control for each trial .
3708	2	3	3	plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type a is the least stretchiest plastic . the student could have improv there design by name the type of brand of type thei us and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap . anoth improv would be measur the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and us the same weight for each trial so that the result would be correct .
3709	2	2	2	base
3710	2	2	2	a . base on the data present in conclus we can sai that plastic type d wa the most stretchabl plastic type . we can make thi conclus becaus plastic type d stretch mm the longest farther than a mm b mm c mm . p b . the student could have us a more studi materi than tape to told up the plastic sampl so it would not affect the stretch of the materi . the student also could have specifi a specif weight to us for each plastic type so that thei were be pull the same amount .
3711	2	2	2	accord to the student data plastic type b seem to stretch the most among the other plastic type as it stretch mm after that . plastic type a stretch onli mm therefor it stretch the least . plastic type c reach mm and plastic type d reach mm . b two wai in which student could have improv their experi is by state exactli how mani weight on should add to the clamp and us a control to improv the varieti of the result .
3712	2	2	2	conclus in conclus polym plastic b had the most stretchabl with mm and palmer plastic a had the least almost of stretchabl with mm valid . he could of bad more trial and includ plastic type in hi procedur .
3713	2	1	1	a base on the inform it have plastic type b ha a high stretchabl compar to plastic type a wa stretchabl is veri low . p b thei should ve ad a materi so we know what thei us to do their experi . also thei should ve wrote conclus so we knew how their experi turn out .
3714	2	0	0	t and t ar veri close with their data . thei could ve increas the time to hang the plastic to ten minut instead of five . thei could have name the plastic .
3715	2	0	0	due to the data each time the student add weight the plastic length seem to increas after the amount of time . for exampl i the type a plastic the first experi is differ their the seem on becaus the do utrecht the plastic more after the first trial . the two wai i believ the student should have improv the experi is by us differ kind of plastic and weight .
3716	2	2	2	base on the student s data plastic type b stretch the most and the nd trial t prove that . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design ar do a third trial to more fulli ensur accuraci and do someth differ in the nd trial like wait minut instead of just .
3717	2	1	2	a plastic type b is easili the most suffici plastic becaus it had the highest measur for both trial . p b . thei could of easili measur for more time . thi wai thei could see how much more it could stretch . . thei could of had on more trial usual an experi ha trial . thi wai averag will be more precis .
3718	2	2	2	base on the student s data we can conclud that plastic type d had the most stretchabl . the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result by do more trial so there can be an averag of the amount stretch instead of have measur that ar both differ and by state how much the weight should weigh becaus differ weight size could caus the plastic to stretch more or less .
3719	2	2	2	a the student plastic seem to get longer with each trial except for plastic type c and d which decreas and stai the same . p b the student could have perform anoth trial . thei also can us differ kind of plastic for the next experi to improv it . and show us the beg length for trial to see how much it stretch .
3720	2	3	2	a my conclus is that plastic b stretch more than the other type of plastic becaus plastic a stretch up to the averag and plastic b had an averag of . . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment ar the student could do more trial and the student could gave the inform about the measur of each sampl of plastic .
3721	2	2	2	a base on the data shown the polym plastic will stretch but not much . plastic type a stretch out the most out of the four . p b on wai the student could have improv is by do more trial . anoth wai it could be improv is by state how much the weight weigh how mani ar be put onto the plastic .
3722	2	2	2	a the conclus could be that plastic d wa the strongest of the plastic becaus it did not stretch at all . p b two wai thi experi could have been improv is by tell how much wright to add to the clamp and the decept of plastic .
3723	2	3	3	a plastic type b had the most stretchabl while plastic type a had the least . p b all the plastic should be the same length . make a machin add the weight and remov them and the clamp b c a human mai place the weight w a differ amount of forc for everi plastic . put two clamp instead of tape b c the tape mai evert it s own forc while the clamp wont .
3724	2	3	3	a in conclus plastic type b wa the most stretchabl polym plastic . p b the student could tell you the size of the polym plastic and make sure all of them ar the same size . also the student can tell you how much weight is be clamp on to the plastic .
3725	2	2	2	a sinc there were four differ type of plastic type b seem to stretch the longest both trail becaus it is most like the strongest . p b perform even more trial for valid and be ar to keep the clamp the weight and wherev you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experi with no weight .
3726	2	2	2	a in trial two the plastic stretch more expect for plastic c . p b the student could have done anoth trial . thei could be specif with how much the weight weigh . the student could have name the type of plastic thei us instead of us a b c and d .
3727	2	2	2	i could conclud that plastic type b wa stretch the most after the experi which would in state that it is the most flexibl . on the other hand plastic type a stretch the least mean it is the least flexibl cut of the plastic type . to improv thi experi the experi could have had more trial accur data . the weight could have been increas and or the trial for better result .
3728	2	3	3	a in conclus polym b is the on that could stretch the most and polym a is the on who can t stretch as wide . p b to make the valid of the experi more accur than thei should of had exact measur for exampl in step the could of said how much it should be hang by . also the could of ad anoth trial it is alwai good to have trial just in case of ani mistak .
3729	2	1	1	a a conclus base on the student data would be that plastic b is the strongest . out of all the plastic at mm . in the first trial had mm in the second trial becaus it stretch more than all the other . p b two the student could have improv the experi and or valid of the result ar to add new type of plastic and add more trial to the contain .
3730	2	2	2	out of the four differ polym plastic for stretchabl the most stretch wa plastic type b . the least amount stretch wa plastic a . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result would have tri differ time length . mayb like minut after minut . repeat the experi all togeth with all type of plastic .
3731	2	1	1	a . accord to the student data of the plastic stretch more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of mm . p b . two wai the student could have improv their experiment design is . thei should have taken more trial at least two more and . thei should us more type of plastic .
3732	2	2	2	base on the data a conclus would be that the plastic type pretti much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial . p thi wai the student could have improv the experi is explain how much the weight weigh and did that weight stai the same for everi type of plastic .
3733	2	2	2	in conclus base on the data from the chart each trial for plastic a b c and d were increas decreas or stai the same . the most stretchabl would be plastic b . it start off as the stretchiest befor it wa pull and remain that wai afterword . p b . the student could have said what type of plastic wa us and not just a b c or d . he also could have done more than trial would have been better .
3734	2	1	1	in conclus plastic type b wa the strongest plastic . in trial it stretch to mm while plastic d onli stretch to mm and c to mm . in trial plastic b stretch to mm while d onli stretch to mm and c to mm . on wai the student could have improv their experiment design wa to stretch the plastic until it wa about to brake to get the full stretchabl . the student could have also done more trial to get more valid result .
3735	2	1	1	my conclus would be that plastic type d stretch the most but not the same amount the nd trial it stretch mm more than the st trial . and plastic type a stretch the least t mm and t mm but it stretch mm more in the nd trial than the first . p two wai thei could have improv the experiment design and for identifi of result is thei could have made anoth trial t at least and could have let the weight hang longer than minut .
3736	2	1	1	a and c did not stretch too far but b and d stretch much more . the student could have given the begin length in hi data or he could have ad more and more weight and seen how far the plastic would stretch .
3737	2	3	3	a the most plastic type b had the most stretchabl in the trial it stretch mm visibl plastic type a stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm while type a stretch mm . p b the student should had the length of the plastic start out he same that wai no plastic could be abl to hold more weight sinc it wa longer . student should also specifi how mani weight ar ad for five minut so that wai a plastic doesn t stretch more just becaus it had more weight .
3738	2	0	0	accord to the data tabl plastic type a wa the most stretchabl . type b and c decreas when measur again after have place weight and type d stai the same . therefor type a wa the most stretchabl consid the longitud it made by mm .
3739	2	2	2	base on our result of the polym investig we found out that plastic type a stretch the most of two mm . type b stretch the second furthest at mm and type c lost mm and final type d didn t lose or gain ani length . two wai the student could have improv the valid wa to make sure he us the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic wa tape at the same spot at the top of the tabl .
3740	2	3	3	i can conclud that plastic type b wa superior and ha more stretch abil than ani other plastic type . p b the student could have ad more trial to secur the valid that plastic type b had the most stretchabl . the student could have drastic improv the experiment design by mention how much the weight weigh .
3741	2	1	1	base on the student data plastic type d stretch the most in both trial . two wai the student could have improv the experi design is on wai thei could of have on more trial and see the result . anoth thing thei could have done wa try to stretch the plastic over a differ type of textur .
3742	2	2	2	a . as shown by the data plastic b wa the plastic that stretch the most . all the other plastic were between while plastic b need the with mm and mm . b . a control alwai improv the valid of date so on would help the experi . more trial could also help so we ar no outlier or mistak .
3743	2	0	2	a it appear that sampl a wa the strongest . after trial it wa mm and after trial it wa mm . sampl b and d were the weakest sampl b after trial wa mm and sampl d wa mm and after trial sampl b wa mm and sampl wa mm . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi is by specif sai what plastic he wa test . anoth wai is by sai how much the weight weigh .
3744	2	2	2	a base on the procedur the result were not valid . how much weight am i suppos to add . p b the valid could have been improv by tell me how much weight to add or what kind of weight to us .
3745	2	1	1	from the student i can draw the conclus that plastic type d ha the least amount of stretchabl it did not stretch at all . the student had a veri thorough procedur but thei could have improv it . thei could have ad more weight to the plastic to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch as well as done more than two trial for each of the differ plastic .
3746	2	3	3	a from the data i am draw the conclus that polym b had the most stretchabl . polym plastic b stretch an averag of . mm which wa greater than polym a c and d . p b . to improv thi experi the student should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sampl to make sure that the type of plastic wa the onli variabl involv . also the student should run more trial to make sure that their result were valid . with more trial the experi will get more result and a better chanc that thei ar accur .
3747	2	2	2	the student conclus would be that plastic b stretch the most . for t it stretch mm and for t it stretch mm . p b the student could have done more trial . thei also could of hard more plastic .
3748	2	3	3	a . plastic type b is the stretchiest of all the plastic test . plastic a is the strongest and stretch the least amount . p b . the student should have an desir that the plastic sheet start out the same length . also must have had the same amount of weight appli .
3749	2	3	2	a . accord to the student s data plastic type b is the most flexibl of the plastic type . p b . first the student could have us a specif length for each plastic strip to begin with becaus thei will most like stretch more if thei ar longer to begin with . second thei should make sure that thei add the same weight for each trial and plastic becaus thei ar measur credibl not how much weight each can hold .
3750	2	0	0	each type of plastic stretch about the same or a coupl millimet off to it counterpart in the second trial . the student could have improv the design by get and tell specif type of plastic to us and to tell us what unit of measur to measur the unstretch and then stretch plastic .
3751	2	3	3	a conclus that can be drawn is that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl of the plastic . the student could improv their experiment design would be to make sure all the differ plastic were the same length befor the weight were ad and make sure to includ that origin measur in the data tabl . the student should also keep the number of weight on the plastic constant becaus if ar plastic had more weight appli to it then anoth it mai appear to have stretch more .
3752	2	0	0	the student have to make sure the test result ar accur and that the answer ar precis .
3753	2	3	3	a . base on the data it can be conclud that plastic type b ha the least strength or the most elast becaus it stretch the farthest of all the other plastic . plastic d is the second and plastic c is the third plastic with least strength or most elast . sinc plastic a had the least stretch length it is the strongest or least plastic plastic . p b . to improv the valid of thi experi it would be wise to sure that each plastic is not onli the same size but is also tape at the exact same spot to the tabl and is clamp at the same spot as well . thi will allow for the remov of other in fenc factor . it is also import to specifi the amount of weight that is us . the same amount of weight should be us for each plastic trial to ensur that weight is not a variabl in the experi .
3754	2	2	2	the plastic type b had stretch the most . to improv thi lab thei could of did more trial to see if their result were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesi base on the start of the lab to know the task at hand .
3755	2	1	0	base on the data tabl both trail were basic the same but thei could have improv the experi by us differ weight so thei could see the differ . also the shouldn t have add a clamp to the and of the plastic .
3756	2	1	1	plastic type d ha better chanc of have stretchabl becaus dure both trial the amount stretch out equal so it ha a accur chanc of stretch . the student could have improv thi experiment design by ad anoth trial and repeat the same procedur .
3757	2	2	2	due to the data i can tell that type d stretch the nd most but wa consist through both trial . i can also see that type a stretch the least amount . type b though stretch the most . from the data i know that type b plastic is the best becaus it can stretch the most without break . thi mean that the chemic bond in the polym ar mostli coval bond . the student could have improv their experi by sai how much weight thei ad as well as be more specif in the procedur about the plastic type .
3758	2	3	3	i can conclud that plastic type a is a stronger plastic that it not veri good a stretch . i would add how much weight to put on the clamp and put in a rd trial .
3759	2	2	2	a the plastic b ha the most amount that stretch . p b the student could of improv their data s by us more test and not the weight an for more time .
3760	2	0	0	a accord to data tabl the plastic had veri littl chang from trial to trial for an exampl plastic type a for trial wa mm and trial wa so it stretch more the second time and for b trail wa and trial wa . for c t wa and t wa but a chang happen on plastic c the measur stand the same for both trial with amount of . b two wai the student had did differ time for each trial . also the clamp thei should have put the plastic some where els caus mayb the clamp had ad more weight .
3761	2	3	3	base on the student s data t conclud that plastic type a wa the strongest plastic becaus it stretch the least amount two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design ar ad a trial and record the origin length of the plastic .
3762	2	2	2	a . base on the student s data . i can conclud that the plastic type d wa the strongest polym stretch mm in trial on and trial . i can also conclud that the plastic type a wa the weakest polym stretch mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial b . on wai the student could have done to improv their experi is perform more trial . anoth wai the student could have improv their experi is to record in the tabl how mani weight us .
3763	2	1	1	a . when the four differ polym plastic were test for stretchabl a second time the result chang drastic for each materi as shown in the data tabl . p b . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result wa by increas the time the materi have to hang and repeat the trial a third time .
3764	2	2	2	in conclus polym plastic b is the plastic that stretch the most in thi investig . p the student could have ad to the result the name each polym plastic . also made each polym plastic the sam length to start with and test each on at the same time .
3765	2	1	1	a i conclud that ha stretch more than . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi design is by . . thei could have ad the amount of weight thei us . thei could have time it .
3766	2	1	1	a . it seem that seem that most of the bag stretch a littl more in the second trial . p b . i think the student could have improv thi experi by do more trial .
3767	2	2	2	a conclus i can make from thi experi is that plastic type b stretch the longest and that plastic a stretch the least . p b two wai the student can improv there experi is by more trial and to put the plastic type in the procedur . for exampl thi student said take a sampl of on type instead she cold have said which on .
3768	2	3	3	i can conclud that the plastic a stretch the least from all the plastic us . and plastic b stretch the most from all the plastic us . plastic a stretch less becaus it wa better than plastic b . the student should have done more than trial . and also should have told us the measur of of the plastic bag . so we could know how much it wa befor it stretch .
3769	2	3	3	base on the student s result polym b wa abl to stretch the furthest length be mm in trial on and mm in trial two . p two wai that the student could improv the experiment design is by specifi in the procedur the weight of each weight and by perform an addit trial .
3770	2	2	2	my hypothesi of i believ that plastic type b will stretch the longest wa correct . plastic type b stretch mm the first trial and mm the second trial . to improv thi experi i would have includ more trial to make sure my experi wa as valid as possibl . i would also make sure that the temperatur of the room i wa in wa same throughout the experi becaus a slight chang in that could caus a big differ between the flexibl of the plastic at that time .
3771	2	2	2	base on the student data plastic type b and c stretch the most while plastic a and c stretch the least in both trial . p on thing the student could have done wa includ the length befor the weight were put on it . anoth thing thei could have done is tell the actual weight amount keep it constant for all plastic type .
3772	2	1	0	some plastic ar stronger than other . p ad more weight . p rock certain brand of waiter bottl .
3773	2	1	1	two wai the student could of improv thi experi is if he would of kept ad weight and measur how low it can go until it break . anoth wai he could of improv thi experi is instead of tape it down a edg tape it down a wall so the forc can go straight down . my conclus base in the student data is the plastic type b is the most stretchabl .
3774	2	0	0	when the student test each plastic a stretch time more than befor . b onli stretch onc more c went down in the second trial but d stai the same . the wai the student could of improv there experi would be if thei graph each trial for each plastic so we could see if it increas decreas or stai the same .
3775	2	2	2	a . a conclus i ve drawn accord to thi tabl would be that plastic type a is a stronger type of plastic . p b . wai to improv the experi would be to add more trial and to have more time of the hang weight and plastic .
3776	2	2	2	the conclus i got for the lab is that there can t be on . we don t know the origin length of plastic . we onli have the two length after thei were stretch . p improv thei should make is to add the origin length of the plastic . anoth improv would be to chang the amount of weight on the plastic .
3777	2	2	2	plastic type b stretch the most at mm over the two trial and plastic a stretch the least at mm . p the student could have improv the experi by do more trial and specifi what kind of plastic thei ar us .
3778	2	2	2	a plastic type b is the most stretchabl plastic . in trial it stretch mm and in trial it stretch mm . p b . the student could have had the clamp attach at the same height in each type of plastic . p . the student should have us the same amount of tape on each type of plastic .
3779	2	2	2	a plastic type a is shown to be the strongest while plastic type b is not . plastic type a stretch at an averag of mm while type b stretch an averag of . mm . p b the student could have improv their experi by list what weight to us and tell which type of lope to us .
3780	2	2	2	a i can infer that plastic type b is the strongest as it stretch the most . p b the student could have improv the experiment design by creat trial and creat an averag of the . also the student should of list the length of the plastic befor and after stretch .
3781	2	3	3	a . base on the student s data plastic b stretch the most and plastic a is the most rigid . p b . the student could have improv their experiment design by us someth stronger than tape to hold the plastic thei also could have done more trial sinc their result between the two trial vari significantli .
3782	2	3	3	the student can conclud that plastic b stretch the most . accord to the data plastic b stretch the most both trial . twenti two mm in the first and twenti three in the second . while the other plastic stretch less . p the student should perform a third trial for accuraci and the student should keep a constant number of weight attach to each plastic .
3783	2	3	3	base on the result plastic b stretch the most than d c a . p the student could of valid hi statement more by give more amount like how much plastic and how much weight . thei could also of valid it by do the trial a rd or th time so it wa more accur .
3784	2	2	2	plastic type a wa the least stretchabl . it onli stretch mm . plastic type b wa the plastic with the greatest stretchabl . it stretch mm . the two trial confirm thi result . the student could improv their data by specifi the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same . also thi test test how the plastic recov after be stretch not how far thei stretch . if thei want to test how far each stretch thei should measur it with the weight attach .
3785	2	1	1	a base on the data plastic type b wa the best best plastic to resist the weight stress . p b the student must have ad a control group and perform more trial .
3786	2	3	3	a base upon the data plastic b wa the most flexibl while plastic a wa the least flexibl . p b the student could improv the experi in two wai . add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experi . . creat a constant start length for each sampl and measur for the increas in length .
3787	2	2	2	a conclus that i can make base off thi data is plastic type a had the biggest size differ between the two trial . on wai the student could improv thi experi is start the plastic all at the same length . thi could help determin which plastic s better . anoth wai is by be more specif as to how mani weight to put on the clamp . if on plastic ha more weight than the anoth it will make thi experi not valid .
3788	2	2	2	my conclus would be accord to the data shown plastic b ha the highest amount be stretch . in trial on and as well as trial two . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be if thei would tell us how much weight to clamp on . also in the tabl includ how much each weight were ad on . as well as try half with weight and the other half with none .
3789	2	1	2	accord to the data given plastic type b had more stretchabl than plastic type a . howev the student should have state the four type of plastic thei us . also thei should have kept the measur of plastic sampl consist .
3790	2	3	2	a base on the result you can tell that plastic type b can hold the most weight and plastic type a can hold the least weight . p b two wai the student could improv the experi wa to do three trial for an accur result and have everi thing the same measur to also be accur .
3791	2	1	1	a a conclus in the student s data is that plastic type d stretch more than the other plastic do . p b the student could have improv by ad on the procedur what type of plastic to us . also the student could have ad how much were the weight he us .
3792	2	2	2	from the data present that plastic type b can be stretch the farthest . but to improv thi experi i would do more trial to make it more accur . also chang the environ could improv the experi . by control the temperatur you can find out which plastic stretch farther in a hot environ or what stretch farther in a colder environ .
3793	2	2	3	base on the student s data plastic type b stretch the most . in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . on the other hand plastic type a stretch the least . in t it stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . so therefor type b and type d were pretti close to on anoth . p on wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by specifi the amount of weight attach to each clamp . anoth wai is by also specifi the amount of the edg tape to the tabl .
3794	2	3	3	a the conclus is that plastic type d is more stretchabl than the most stretchabl plastic a . p i d improv thi thei should have includ how much weight wa put into each bug and also measur of the bag befor thei do the experi .
3795	2	2	2	a . plastic type b ha the most stretch abil . as well as plastic a have the least . p b . . thei could have specifi which plastic thei us not just a b c d . . thei could tell us how much weight thei put on the clamp .
3796	2	1	1	plastic b is the most ductil follow by plastic d c and a respect . when discuss the valid of the experi it is best to have an averag of the two trial . also thi person did not includ the initi length unstretch of the plastic . thei should have all been cut to the same length to start with .
3797	2	1	1	base on the data i can conclud that plastic a b stretch more than c d . the student could have improv the valid of thi experi by conduct more trial . with more trial it is easier to take a more accur averag . next the could also sai the type of plastic . instead of sai a b c d their experi would be better develop . easier for the reader to follow . thi is what can be conclud from the data along with what could be improv throughout the experi .
3798	2	2	2	base on the data you can draw of conclus of plastic type d not stretch from t or t . the plastic measur mm both trial . the student also could have includ how much plastic is be us . the student also should have includ how much mani weight you hold on to the clip .
3799	2	2	2	a in conclus it is clear that plastic type a stretch the least over the five minut . the plastic that wa the stretchiest wa plastic b . p b add a control with no weight ad and a third trial .
3800	2	2	2	i conclud that polym b had the highest rate of stretchabl of mm for t and mm for t . p the student could have ad a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add .
3801	2	2	1	a . the data wasn t a clear statement and is inconclus and thei need anoth trial . p b . thei could have test it on more time and if thei do thei test would be conclus and be abl to draw a conclus .
3802	2	3	3	a . plastic b ha the greatest abil to stretch becaus it stretch the most in t and t . p b . on wai to improv the experi would be to specifi how long each sampl is at the begin of each trial and have them all the same initi length i . e mm . p anoth wai to improv thi experi is to specifi an exact weight to be clamp to each plastic sampl i . e . gram .
3803	2	0	0	a both trial and trial ar basic the same and their constant to each other their wasn t a big chang . p b mayb for step thei could add more time and get heavier weight .
3804	2	3	2	for the polym investig lab experi my conclus from the data is that plastic type b wa the most break resist and stretch the most at mm . two wai the student could of improv the experi is in prouder on . it said to measur the length should be a certain length for all the plastic . my second thing is how heavi ar the weight in the experi that hung on the bag .
3805	2	3	3	accord to the student s data plastic type b had the greatest capabl of stretch becaus it stretch an averag of . mm . plastic type a onli stretch and averag of mm . on wai the student could chang the experi is by cut each plastic sampl length mai be a contribut factor affect result . anoth wai to improv the experi is by tape all the plastic at the same place on the tabl so an equal amount of plastic is hang of the edg .
3806	2	1	1	a
3807	2	3	3	in total we came a conclus that plastic type b stretch the furthest in both trial i and in and plastic a stretch the least in trial i and in . p two wai the student could have improv the experi design and or result wa by state how mani the weight were and did more trial .
3808	2	3	3	base on the student s data plastic a stretch the least amount . plastic b stretch the most . plastic d stretch the same amount of mm dure trial and trial . to improv the experiment design the student should have start off with all the plastic type be the same length befor start the experi . anoth wai to improv the result would be to us all the same weight ad to the clamp each time . differ weight can caus differ result .
3809	2	1	3	to conclud thi experi . i would state that plastic b stretch the most . in trial it stretch to and in trial it reach mm . compar to plastic a reach mm . to improv the student experi i would have them make sure that when thei put the plastic bag dawn thei put it at the same space for a more accur answer . and lastli thei could hold more trial to improv valid of the experi .
3810	2	0	0	a the polym experi look it went veri well . each plastic amount that wa stretch wa all around the same number for both trial . two type of plastic increas after the first trial on type of stai the same amount and on type of plastic decreas after the first trial . p b i don t think the student need ani thing to improv thi experi .
3811	2	1	1	a as a conclus base on the data t plastic test were more elast than ti . p b the student could improv thi by address how mani weight were us and allow them to hang for at least two minut more and to get new plastic tap instead of us the remain .
3812	2	2	2	plastic type b wa the most stretchi and stretch the most in trial and trial . the student could have ad a control in these and also he could have done more trial for each separ type of plastic .
3813	2	1	1	a . base on the data i conclud that plastic b wa the best plastic in trial it measur mm and trial it measur mm mean it wa the sturdiest plastic . p b . the student could have measur the plastic befor do the experi make it a free trial and the student could have ad the weight and see how much weight it could hold befor it fell to the floor instead of wait for minut .
3814	2	0	0	a base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type a and b ar stretchabl while plastic type c and d made no improv . p b a wai the experi and valid could have been improv is by allow the weight to hang longer . anoth wai is to try and measur the polym plastic more than onc after be pull .
3815	2	2	1	a . i conclud that plastic b work the best becaus it held in most weight like and the lowest wa so therefor plastic b work the best . p b . what thei could have done wa add more trial or chang the type of cup .
3816	2	2	2	a plastic type b is the stretchiest . p b the student could have done more trial . the student could have put in the a averag to chart in order to make an easier comparison .
3817	2	1	1	a plastic type b and d ar better to us becaus thei stretch the stretchiest . plastic b can stretch up to mm at most while plastic d can stretch up to mm at most . plastic c and plastic a can stretch the least becaus plastic c can stretch up to mm at most while plastic a can stretch up to mm at most . p b two wai thei would have improv the experi is by ad more trial and tell what each plastic actual wa .
3818	2	0	0	a i can conclud that t did better than t and that plastic type b did better than a c d . p b
3819	2	2	2	a conclus base on the student s data is that plastic type b stretch the farthest over all becaus in the data it sai it stretch mm and mm as where the other plastic did not stretch as far . p two wai the student could have improv their experi is by have a control and by give an exact measur for how much plastic you should us becaus if there is a larger piec it could look as if is stretch farther than it realli did .
3820	2	2	2	plastic b ha the greatest stretchabl . p the student can improv hi experi if he doe more trial us differ type of weight increas the hang time and us on more plastic .
3821	2	3	3	base on the data the b type plastic is the most stretchabl . in the first trial it wa stretch mm and in the second mm . the student could improv the experi by through if he tell us which amount of weight he us . also the student could try the experi for a longer period of time and then do thi experi than twice .
3822	2	2	2	a . the student could conclud that plastic b is the most stretchabl out of the four plastic becaus it end up the longest in both trial after it wa stretch . p b . on wai to improv thi experi would be to specifi in step how mani pound of weight ar be stretch . thi would make sure that in each experi it is the same amount of weight that is pull the plastic down . anoth wai would be to mayb collect data over on minut interv .
3823	2	2	2	plastic type b had the most stretchabl becaus it stretch further than ani other plastic for both trial . the student should have done anoth trial and have a control group .
3824	2	1	2	two wai the student could have improv thi experi could have been by tell me what thei were us as weight . and also how thei were measur the plastic after the trial wa over .
3825	2	0	1	in conclus thi experi is not accur becaus it did not list the type of plastic that would be us for thi experi . the time wa not even record . there ha got to be evid throughout thi experi . for plastic type d the amount stretch wa the same by min . i want to know what type of materi were us . p the student could have record the time and also show the type of materi that were us throughout the experi .
3826	2	3	2	plastic type b stretch the furthest in both trial mean that it had the largest stretchabl . on wai that the student could have improv the experi would be to specifi and includ in the procedur or clarifi in thi data tabl if that wa the the dimens of hi plastic sampl . that wai same the abl would be the result were strictli describ and compar the stretchabl of the sampl and there were an outsid sourc try the outcom . anoth wai he could improv the valid of hi lab is regul how much weight he ad to the clamp and a lot includ that in hi procedur or data tabl in order to present hi experi more clearli .
3827	2	2	2	a the more weight ad to sampl b and a the more thei stretch . plastic c shrunk as weight wa ad to t . plastic d could have be stretch . p b . . the student could give the start length so there wa someth to compar the result to . p . the student could have mention how mani weight were ad each how much weight wa pull on the plastic .
3828	2	2	3	a conclus i can make is trial plastic type d is the most stretchabl and type a is the least stretchabl . the student could have improv the experi by indic and us a specif amount of weight that is unchang between plastic type and trial . also the student could have indic and us a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic .
3829	2	2	2	a . plastic type b stretch the greatest amount and therefor held the most weight . p two wai the student could have improv their experi ar by includ the much each weight weigh and the exact length of each plastic us to valid their result . a constant variabl wa not includ .
3830	2	2	2	a base on the student data plastic type b wa stretch longer than ani other plastic type . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa at given what type of plastic thei us and to provid the amount of weigh thei ad to each clamp gram le o etc . .
3831	2	2	1	a . it seem that in the most ductil polym is plastic type b at cm . for it is again plastic type b at cm . so it seem type b polym is the ductil polym . p p b . to better enhanc the result of the polym experi then should inlaid the length of the polym unstretch .
3832	2	0	0	for both trial thei had similar result . thei could have improv their experi by ad more weight instead of keep them the same .
3833	2	2	2	in my polym investig i discov that plastic type b had stretch the most in both trial with mm in trial and mm in trail . the plastic type to stretch the least wa type a with t be mm and t mm . on wai the could of improv the valid of the result is to make a averag of both trial . also anoth wai is to sai how much weight is be us to show consist . final thei need a control with no weight becaus the clamp effect the data .
3834	2	0	0	a conclus for thi experi could be type t had been the strongest for the st two trial and then type t start last longer and in the end thei stai the same . still show that type t wa the best choic . it show that in the end type b wa the strongest . the student could have improv their experi by name the type of bag brand thei were test and thei also could have clamp the bag a differ wai for exampl tape it to both side and put weight .
3835	2	2	2	thi instig ha show that the polym from plastic type b wa the most stretchabl than the rest . thi experi could ve been alter by ad that each weight should have been carefulli place especi toward the end . there should ve been a certain amount of weight put on so that the measur of the plastic were done fairli .
3836	2	3	2	the conclus of the investig could be that plastic a wa the best becaus when weight were ad didn t stretch that much compar to the other plastic . two wai the student could ve improv the experi is by ad the same weight to each plastic and when start the experi us plastic with the same length .
3837	2	3	3	plastic type b ha the highest stretchabl as it stretch and mm the furthest . plastic type a is the least stretchabl it onli stretch and mm the least out of all . thi experi would be more valid if the student had trial instead of onli to rule out ani problem . the student should have also specifi the amount constant length of plastic .
3838	2	2	1	a plastic type b ha the most stretchabl in all plastic sampl and plastic type a ha the least . b . he could repeat the lab more and increas variabl wa .
3839	2	0	0	the conclus came out to be that the nd trial wasn t realli that much at a differ between trial . most of them wa or differ . d stood the same .
3840	2	2	2	my conclus is plastic type b is the most stretchi . in t it stretch to m and in t it stretch to . the least stretchi would be plastic type a . in t it got to and in t it got to . i order of the stretchiest would be b d c and a . thei could have taken some time of step and did on to two more trail .
3841	2	1	1	in conclus two wai the student could have improv the experi design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time . also anoth wai the student could have improv the design is to add the same weight to the plastic .
3842	2	3	3	a base on the experi plastic type a is the strongest of all plastic plastic b is the weakest . b is the weakest becaus it stretch the most and thi could be becaus the plastic is thin while plastic a wa more thick instead of a linear polym like b plastic a wa probabl a thatch polym with mani differ bond . p b to improv the experi the student should have us the same amount of each plastic to test . the size of the plastic add anoth variabl to the experi . thei should also specifi which weight thei us and should make the weight for each plastic constant .
3843	2	1	1	i think plastic d is the strongest becaus it s the highest weight and thei ar both even in trial and . p the first thing thei can chang is add a few more trial so thei can realli see if it stai the same or chang . anoth wai is to add more weight to each piec of plastic .
3844	2	2	2	plastic b can stretch the most . thei could ve said the weight of the weight ar us .
3845	2	0	0	b the student could have possibl ad more weight to each trial that thei did to get more reason and notic result . the result shown below aren t as aromat as you can see . also the student could have ad more time for each time he repeat the investig .
3846	2	2	3	base on the data i believ that plastic b ha the best stretchabl and it strong . p the student could have ad a trial just so the experi could be accur and instead of cut all the plastic yourself get recur so thei all be the same size .
3847	2	0	0	the conclus is plastic type have and amount stretch . the two wai the student take a sampl of on type of plastic and measur it length and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minut .
3848	2	2	2	base on the student data you can tell that plastic type b wa the strongest type of plastic base on the student data . not onli that plastic type b wa the strongest it stretch the farthest too . two wai the student could have fix their experiment design is by the follow wai . the student should have told how heavi the weight were . also the student should have told hoe much weight were need in their experiment design .
3849	2	0	0	thi data is not accur becaus thei got a differ number all the time and thei onli got the same number onc .
3850	2	3	3	nor .
3851	2	2	2	base on the student s result it can be conclud that plastic type a stretch the most and ha the most stretchabl . howev their experi contain mani variabl so thi conclus mai not be necessarili true . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design would be to make all the plastic type the same initi length and then to record how much thei stretch . thi would make the experi more valid . secondli thei should have more than two trial to improv the valid of the result .
3852	2	3	3	a plastic b is the stretchiest polym plastic becaus of the amount of mm it stretch in the span of five minut . p b the student need to make each sampl of plastic the exact same size and to improv the valid the could complet a third trial .
3853	2	3	3	plastic type b stretch the longest of them all with mm for it first trial and mm for the second trial . thei could have improv the experiment design by measur to make sure that on type of plastic isn t longer than anoth type . thei also could have done anoth trial for more accur result .
3854	2	1	1	a plastic b had the greatest length in both trial . p b the student could have us more weight and thei could do the experi over again to get better result .
3855	2	2	2	we know that plastic type b stretch the furthest . thei could have said how long the plastic wa when thei start . thei could have put the name of the type of plastic .
3856	2	2	1	plastic type b stretch the most . on wai the student could of improv the experiment design and valid is that thei should of told how long it wa befor thei tri and stretch it . a second wai thei could improv it is tell you what type of plastic thei us .
3857	2	1	1	a base on the student data i conclud that plastic type b is the most flexibl type a is the least and type d remain the same throughout the trial . p b the studi could have improv the experiment design and valid of result by ad heavier weight to the experi and extend or shorten the min time period .
3858	2	0	0	i don t think that s a valid answer but do to their conclus depend on the plastic it could either increas or decreas in size .
3859	2	0	0	a the second try ha almost the same amount of stretchabl the first try ha . p b when ad weight allow them to stai for more than minut . p or thei could of stretch it out more wider .
3860	2	2	1	a the strongest polym would be plastic type b . it is plastic type b becaus it stretch the most out of all the other plastic in both trial . p b on wai that you would increas the valid would to measur how much a plastic stretch when you put the clamp on it . anoth wai to further valid the experi is to do a lot more trial for more result .
3861	2	2	2	a . base on the data plastic type b stretch the most while plastic type a stretch the least . thi tell me that plastic type b is the most stretchabl . p b . thei could have ad some sort of control and ad on more trial . both would help improv the accuraci of the result .
3862	2	2	3	a plastic type b ha the most stretchabl with a differ of to mm with type d that ha the second most stretchabl follow by type c with a differ of mm with type b and type a with a differ of mm with type b . b he should have specifi the total weight of the weigh and clamp he us to stretch the plastic . it also could have measur all dimens length width height of the plastic type rather than just the length .
3863	2	1	1	plastic type b is the type of plastic you want to put heavi product in becaus it is more durabl than plastic type a which stretch onli mm unlik plastic type b which is mm . p on wai the student could have improv the experi is by give the amount of how much the weight weigh . also give the height of the tabl top to the floor .
3864	2	3	3	a base on the data plastic b wa the most stretchabl plastic . thi is becaus on averag it stretch . mm in length . the next highest amount stretch by plastic d wa an averag of mm in length show that plastic b stretch the most . b on wai the student s could ve improv their design is by ad a third trial . thi could help make sure there wa no faulti data such as an outlier . thei also could ve written the amount of weight that wa stretch the plastic . otherwis for all the prove thei could ve been chang these weight which would ve given them independ variabl therefor make their experi invalid .
3865	2	3	3	on conclus you can draw is that plastic sampl b ha the best stretchabl . p the student could have made thi better or more valid by have a third trial as well . and state how much weight is be ad to the plastic .
3866	2	2	2	a . base on the student s data plastic d is the best plastic type to us for stretchabl . p b student could have improv the experiment design or valid of result is by sai the type of plastic thei us . ex kitchen wrap groceri bag cook wrap etc . thei should mention add the weight of each clamp us for each plastic wrap . and at last have more trial .
3867	2	2	2	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic b stretch the farthest on both trial and that plastic a stretch the least . the student could have improv the experiment design by name instead of label the plastic type . that would have given more inform and also name the type of plastic would have given us an idea of how the polym plastic influenc it stretchabl . also for the valid of the result the student could includ time and more trial .
3868	2	0	0	a . thi base on the type of bag . p b . we could us anoth plastic type and will try the amount of stretch .
3869	2	1	1	a plastic type b stretch the most at mm and mm . plastic type a stretch the least with mm and mm . p b the student could have improv there experiment design by sai what type of plastic it is . anoth wai thei could ve improv is by sai the repeat step .
3870	2	2	2	base on the the student s data a conclus would be that sampl b is the stretchiest also materi c and d have good stretchabl as long as you don t stretch it twice . on wai thei could improv would be that instead of measur the substanc onc you take the clamp off measur it with it on becaus onc you take it off it will be shorten a littl . anoth wai could be to clarifi how much weight to add onto each materi .
3871	2	1	1	a base on the data i can conclud that some of the plastic increas by or decreas by . p b to improv the investig the student should have ad anoth trial to see how it improv .
3872	2	0	0	in conclus plastic type b wa the strongest out of all the plastic type . it stretch the most . plastic type a wa the weakest . p these student could have improv their experi by write record your data in the procedur after each trial . also thei could have creat a graph to show their result in a clearer wai .
3873	2	2	2	a conclus i ve made base on the student data is all of the plastic increas the stretch except for plastic type c that decreas . i also saw that plastic type b stretch the most . two wai the student could have improv thi experiment design wa by ad more trial and by us differ kind of weight .
3874	2	1	2	base on the student s data plastic b both trial had the most millimet for the amount the plastic stretch . plastic b first trial had mm and the second trial had mm . also plastic d wa the second plastic to have the most millimet for plastic stretch . at trial on it wa at mm also for trial two . on wai the student could have improv their experi is by let us know if were suppos put weight in on at a time or how mani . also for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decreas or increas .
3875	2	2	2	accord to the result polym a is the strongest . it could hold the most weight without stretch . the more a polym stretch the closer it wa to break so that is why a wa the strongest . the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of the result is to insur that thei ar us the name type of polym for each on and that thei ar ad the same amount of weight to each polym . that will improv the result .
3876	2	3	2	plastic stretch the most it had stretch mm and mm . plastic a stretch the least it stretch mm and mm . the student would have improv thei experi by write more detail like write what wa the beg length and write how much the weight weigh . thei also could have put an experiment control like us a piec of metal instead of plastic .
3877	2	0	0	b . perform the second trial differ than the first . p . repeat with fresh plastic . p . add more than on type of plastic .
3878	2	3	3	it can be conclud that plastic type b is the stretchiest of the plastic and that plastic type a is the least stretchiest . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa by do more trial to data in more result and by specifi the exact mass of the weight hang from the plastic .
3879	2	3	3	plastic type a stretch the least . thei could have made thi environ better by tell all thi you what the plastic were . thei could have said how much weren t thei us . thei final could have said what the start length should be .
3880	2	3	2	from thi experi i can conclud that plastic type b stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least . p make all the other plastic the same size of the first on . thei also could of made anoth trial with a differ set sampl of each plastic .
3881	2	2	2	in conclus plastic type b wa stretch the most in trial on and in trial two . to improv thi experi about polyp her plastic for stretchabl would be to us a differ wai to show the data . for exampl a graph chart . anoth wai to improv thi experi would be to record the length of the plastic without have it stretch .
3882	2	3	3	a . the student s data show that the type b plastic is the most stretchi while type a plastic is the least stretchi . type c is almost the same firm as a and d ha almost the same stretch as b . p b the student could have improv their experi by state the weight of the weight thei us to make sure thei us the same weight for each plastic type . thei could have repeat the experi more to valid their result .
3883	2	1	1	a in conclus each a b c and d had differ result . a and c stretch more . both trial and had differ answer accept plastic type d it rear the same . p b to improv thi experi student could of made more trial for more accur answer . also repeat the step .
3884	2	0	0	thei ad up around each other mean the stretch all almost the same all plastic it wa the same both trial . p thei could put rang info on the data tabl and thei could of describ the procedur better .
3885	2	1	1	from the data i conclud that type d plastic type hold it plastic under weight stai at mm and type a plastic type wa the wors drop mm . thei should ve test the bag wit a varieti of weight . also i would ve done on more trial to see if the number stai constant .
3886	2	3	3	base on the student s data plastic type b stretch the most compar to plastic type a c and d . therefor b ha the most stretchabl . two wai to improv the experiment design ar to make sure each plastic start at the same length and that the same amount of weight ar us for each plastic .
3887	2	3	3	a conclus i have drawn is that plastic type b is the best plastic in thi experi . i know thi becaus the data show that it had stretch the most compar to the other three plastic in five minut . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and the valid of the result would be in perform the experi again and make sure the same weight ar us . by perform the experi again the data would be shown four time instead of two and for onc accur . by us the same weight we would know that the plastic ar stretch fulli .
3888	2	3	3	a . plastic b stretch the most d the second most c the second least and a the least . p b . for on student case have includ more trial onli two trial is not that mani and could have found and take result . more trial would have increas the valid . for anoth the incid have specifi the weight of the weight in the procedur leav that unspecifi leav that variabl uncontrol therefor therefor specifi the weight of the weight would have been highli been held to both the experiment to design and the valid .
3889	2	2	2	base on the data plastic type a stretch the least . follow by b d c . plastic a stretch the most with two mm . on wai thei could improv it is to test it more time . thei could also have mention the weight of the weight he us to stretch the plastic .
3890	2	1	2	in conclus plastic type b stretch the most while a and c were approxim the same . d stai the same for both trial mm . p the student could have perform a rd trial with the plastic type . also thei could have let the plastic hang longer than minut .
3891	2	1	1	b tell what the a weight of weight were .
3892	2	2	2	that plastic a wa more durabl than plastic b . p for on he she could been more specif with the plastic type and the amount of weight need to be us .
3893	2	2	2	the conclus that i have draw from thi data is that two plastic did stretch while on stai the same and on other seem to shrink . two wai that thi student could have improv the experi is by have what type of plastic that is go to be test all the same length befor the hang them of the tabl and the amount of weight includ there mass to improv the valid of thi experi and it result .
3894	2	2	2	a . the conclus is that plastic type d is the materi that ha stretch the most plastic type a stretch the least . on wai that the student could have improv would be by ad a timer into the procedur . also to have the same weight of each plastic .
3895	2	3	3	a from thi data on can conclud that plastic type b stretch the most in both trial . the data support that thi polym plastic ha the most specifi what length the four plastic should all start at . in order to increas the valid of the experi . thei could also have specifi what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pull by on equal amount .
3896	2	3	3	plastic type b ha the greatest stretchabl out of the other four . the student could have done more trial . thei could of also tell us a specif weight .
3897	2	2	3	base on the student data the plastic type a of trial wa stretch less than the plastic type b of trial from a mm and b mm . also the trial have differ result of type a from trial plastic type a stretch . mm and trial plastic type a stretch mm . the student could have improv the experi design by ad more trial and measur the amount of weight .
3898	2	2	2	the student s data reveal that plastic a could be most resid to stretch . on wai the student could have improv thi experi is add more trial . anoth wai is add control to the experi .
3899	2	0	0	a if you hang weight on plastic type b then it will stretch at least inch . p b thei could of told of what type of plastic thei us and which on wa the control .
3900	2	2	2	by the data given in the tabl plastic type a wa the most stretchabl while plastic d wa the strongest and didn t stretch at all . the student could ve improv the experi by state how much wa the weight appli on the plastic also thei could ve us a better wai to stick the plastic on the tabl .
3901	2	1	0	in thi experi plastic a and c where the on that stretch least b and d stretch the most plastic a in t stretch mm and in t it stretch mm . plastic b stretch on t and in t c stretch in t and t . d stretch in t and in t . so the ar that stretch most wa plastic b . i think the student could of improv the experi by chang the wai the stretch to how fast you can rip and punctur also put less plastic to try .
3902	2	2	2	a base on the student s data plastic type b stretch the most while type a wa the least stretchabl . p b wai the student could have improv ar on tell what the length of each plastic wa to begin with and make sure thei ar all the same length and also differ length of time could have been test like minut instead of minut .
3903	2	3	3	a from the student s data we can conclud that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl stretch an averag . mm per trial compar to type d s mm type c s . mm and type a s mm . p b on wai the student could have improv is by increas the number of trial carri out which will increas data accuraci and lessen the effect of outlin . a second wai he could ve improv is by state the weight of the weight he us . not specifi thi could lead to variat of data and almost imposs to replic the experi .
3904	2	2	2	a plastic type b wa the stretchiest and plastic type a wa least stretchiest . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of the result ar on do a third trial for each plastic and two test a control which will not stretch .
3905	2	0	0	a base on the data t d like to includ that plastic d had stretch the longest of all . i can also see that all the plastic stretch except for plastic c . . . it wa the onli plastic that got shorter rather than stretch . p b i think that the onli improv that thi experi need wa to possibl increas the tim more minut befor part the next trial . valid on the experi with no chang is correct becaus the us extra trial .
3906	2	2	2	a the conclus is that plastic type b ha more stretchabl than the other . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi wa that thei should have repeat the experi multipl time to make sure that it is accur and thei didn t put time on how mani minut the plastic should be stretch .
3907	2	1	1	base on student data i notic that the trial two t plastic stretch longer then most plastic in trial on t . i believ the student could have made the time period that thei were stretch for longer . i believ some plastic could have stretch more . also i think that in their procedur thei should have discuss the amount of weight thei put on the clamp for futur refer .
3908	2	2	2	a that for the first trial plastic type b stretch more for the second trial plastic type b stretch more mm and it end up the most plastic that ha stretch . p b the two wai the student could have improv the experi is by have more trial and by us the type of plastic that thei were us .
3909	2	0	0	a conclus i can make is that all the plastic type and trial were all about the same thing . p hang the clamp for more than minut attach clamp to top edg .
3910	2	3	3	base on the data provid by the student i have conclud that plastic type b stretch the most in both trial and trial . p on wai the student could have improv the experi wa by have a continu for exampl thei could have done a third trial to see if there wa anymor chang . the second wai the student could have improv the experi wa by give the length of each plastic to see if thei were the same .
3911	2	2	2	a conclus i draw from the data is that plastic type b is the most stretchabl plastic of them all . the data support thi answer caus on averag it stretch . mm farther than the other and . mm farther then plastic a two wai student could have improv result of to includ more trial caus it hard to get a good averag of two trial . also i would try ad more trial with differ weight becaus mayb ar plastic is the stretchabl when at lower weight .
3912	2	0	0	the two wai the student could have improv the experiment design is repeat the procedur exactli for the remain three plastic sampl .
3913	2	2	2	a from the experi the student perform we can conclud that plastic type a stretch the most as compar to plastic type b c d becaus from t it start at and to t it went to . wherea for the other it stretch onli mm and in type a it stretch mm . p b the student could improv thi experi by ad more trial so thei could get better and more precis result . thei could also be more specif about the weight and tell us what to start with small weight and then gradual get to heavier on or us all the same .
3914	2	0	0	i dont think hi stretchabl investig work . i feel that the student didnt ha to exactli respect everyth time and thei didnt have add weight to clamp and allow them hang .
3915	2	2	3	i can conclud that on averag plastic b wa the most stretchi plastic . valid could have been improv if the student state how heavi the weight ar in step . also the student could have state an exact point on the tabl so that all plastic were in the same condit to make the experi more valid .
3916	2	2	2	a in conclus plastic b stretch the longest while plastic a stretch the least . p b the student could of told us what type of plastic to us in the procedur . the student could of also tri more trial to see if the stretch plastic chang size .
3917	2	2	2	base on the result plastic type a stretch the least and plastic type b stretch the most therefor the order for the stretchiest plastic polym is b d c then a . the student could have us the same weight on each of the polym . the student could have specifi how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastic .
3918	2	0	0	base on the data . i can see that most of the plastic wrap either stai the same or increas on the length stretch out . i can sai the weight did have an impact on how long it stretch out to be overal it wa a good experi w inform but there could ve been improv . next time i would recommend try differ weight to see if the amount of weight will determin the length . also we can add more time to how long the weight stai on the plastic .
3919	2	2	2	i conclud from thi lab that plastic type b stretch the most out of all of the polym . thi mean it ha more elast than the other . i also conclud that plastic type a stretch the least out of all of the polym . thi mean it ha less elast than the other type of polym . p on wai the student could improv the lab is to add more trial . that would make the hypothesi more true . anoth wai is by delet human mistak by mean correctli and thing like that .
3920	2	2	2	a after test and collect data i compar each result and i it either stretch by to mm each test sometim it don t move . p a . by do more trial and by have the same amount of weight in each on .
3921	2	2	2	a base on the student data i can conclud that plastic b ha the most stretchabl . the data show that in both trial t and t plastic b stretch and . p b the student could have done anoth trial to make their data more valid thei also could have let the weight hang more than five minut .
3922	2	3	3	the result from the student polym lab show that plastic type b stretch furthest in both that s then ani other materi . the student could have improv the experi by tell how much weight to add to each same and by tell how to specif add them i . f . shortli or by just drop the weight on the clamp . as alwai more trial will increas the valid of ani result in a scienc lab .
3923	2	2	2	a good conclus i can make from the data is type a and c were the most alik and type b and d were the most alik . for exampl for t type a had and type c had and for t type b had and type d had . the student could have improv the experiment design by tell the reader how much plastic should be hang down the tabl and also he should have been told how heavi the weight were .
3924	2	1	1	base on the student s data the conclus i have drawn up is that plastic b wa the most stretchi in both trial and trial . plastic b stretch the most out of all the plastic . two wai thi student could have improv the experiment design wa to have a constant and to add that there ar four differ type of plastic not just on .
3925	2	2	2	a . the conclus would be that plastic b had the most stretchabl while plastic a had the least . p b . two wai thei could improv their experi would be to add more trial . truli good experi ha at least trial . anoth would be to make the procedur more understand . and thei should keep the weight on for longer thi will give more extens and accur data .
3926	2	0	0	base on the data that ha been record it list that the second trial that thei did with the bag wa the trial where the bag were abl to hold on to the weight and stretch out the most . a wai that the student could of have improv their experi would ve been to add more weight and see at how much thei would of rip instead of wait minut .
3927	2	2	2	a i came to the conclus that plastic type b had the most stretchabl out of all plastic . plastic b wa stretch to an averag of . p b the student could have improv hi experiment design by conduct a third trial and tell the reader what plastic were involv d in the experi .
3928	2	2	2	the student found that the weakest polym is b and the strongest is a on the first trial b stretch mm and on the second trial it stretch mm howev a wa the strongest becaus on the first that it stretch mm and on the second trial . it stretch mm without break . the student could have improv their excrement by be more specif about the differ polym us thei could appli the weight onto the plastic instead of the clamp to see how much it dent the plastic and thei should do more trial .
3929	2	2	3	all of the plastic stretch plastic a stretch the least plastic b stretch the most . p wai the student could of improv the experiment design is by do a rd trial and also sai how much weight wa ad .
3930	2	2	1	the second trial of the plastic stretch a littl more . on actual decreas a mm . the student should ve done it a better wai instead of tape it to side of the tabl . also thei could ve have much weight thei were ad to the clamp .
3931	2	1	1	base on the data document in the tabl i can conclud that over that plastic type d ha the most elast becaus on both trial it stretch to mm . two wai that the student could have improv the design or valid could have been to specifi the amount of the weight be us and specifi on what type of plastic to us . thi would make the valid higher .
3932	2	2	1	base on the data tabl each trail for each type of plastic wa fairli similar . also from the tabl it is clear to see that plastic is wa the most flexibl as it stretch mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial . plastic a wa the least flexibl . the first trial stretch mm in length and in the second trial mm . therefor out of all the plastic plastic b had the greatest stretchabl . howev on wai the result could have been improv is by measur the length mm of the plastic when thei break or even after a longer period of time . thi will show the true stretchabl of each plastic . anoth improv could be name type of plastic that were be futur trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good us .
3933	2	0	0	a plastic a wa mm long then it reach out to mm plastic b wa mm then went to mm plastic c wa mm then went to mm plastic d wa mm than stai the same . b on wai thi student could have improv wa to give us the type of plastic besid sai take on sampl of a plastic anoth wai wa to give exampl give more detail . i sai the valid is not right becaus if i want my store thi experi exactli from word to word then i would have gotten someth differ .
3934	2	1	0	the conclus base on the student s data is that plastic type b did the best out of all of the other plastic type in both trial and . also two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of the experi again and to us more plastic type .
3935	2	2	2	in conclus our hypothesi wa ride becaus plastic type b stretch the most instead of plastic type c . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design of the result ar thei could have includ how much weight thei put on the clamp and also thei could have left the weight on far mo re than minut .
3936	2	3	3	base on the student data the plastic type b wa the plastic with the most stretchabl . the group could have improv their design by specifi how much weight weigh and kept it constant by have each weight the same . also thei should have includ befor and after length in their design tabl .
3937	2	2	2	a plastic b ha most cross link becaus it is the strongest and stretch furthest . p b the student should have increment in which the weight ar ad and how much of the plastic should be hang off the side . each plastic should be the same length .
3938	2	1	1	a base on the data shown in the tabl . on strongest type of wa plastic b . but plastic d had a constant amount of stretch . p b on wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa by includ how much weight to add . also to compar the result with ani other student who perform hi same experi .
3939	2	0	0	b . the student could have improv there experi by make differ data graph . thei could have also improv there experi by solv the result by ad or subtract .
3940	2	2	2	a with the given data plastic type b ha the most stretchabl due to it stretch of mm and mm . none of the other plastic type stretch as much plastic d on the closest at mm . b the student could have improv the valid of the experi by elimin a larg variabl creat which ha the length of each sampl at a constant length . also he could have measur the length ar smaller amount such as everi minut not everi minut .
3941	2	3	3	a base on the student data plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic . p b make all origin length equal i add the same weight undefin in the procedur . find a wai besid tape to hold the plastic .
3942	2	0	0	a my conclus is that the experi wa veri in organ and not well thought out . p b these student could have improv their experiment design by on tell us the materi thei us like what kind of plastic object thei us like whether or not thei were stretchabl . just to give us more of a second thought about how theyr data came out . thei could have organ their data a lot better .
3943	2	2	2	i conclud that after see the data that plastic type b is the most stretchabl out of all the plastic . i sai thi becaus in trial it stretch mm and trial it stretch mm . the plastic that stretch the closest to that wa type d which stretch to mm both time . two wai that thei could have improv in lab valid is on ad a third trial to each plastic . and two take the same of the trial and find in weight stretch for each type .
3944	2	3	3	a . plastic type b stretch the farthest in both trial while plastic type a stretch the least mean type b wa more stretchabl than type a . p b . on wai the student could ve improv thi experi would be to add a control group so you could see the initi length of the plastic . anoth wai would be to to add more trial to averag out the stretchabl .
3945	2	3	2	a . plastic type a is stronger than the rest . p b . there a set length and width for each piec of plastic instead of it be whatev it happen to be . a differ size mai mean a differ in durabl and strength .
3946	2	0	0	a base on the data tabl plastic type a had the most amount stretch so it is the stretch . p b on thing thei could have done wa add weight and see which on would rip faster anoth thing thei could of done wa add more time .
3947	2	3	3	a . i conclud that plastic b is the strongest with an averag stretch length of . mm . plastic a is the least stretchiest with an averag of mm . plastic d is the second stretchiest with an averag of mm and plastic c is the third with . mm as the averag . p b . thei could have had a constant begin plastic length . p thei could have had a standard weight of the weight and tri stretch with heavier or lighter weight for a rd trial to see how the weight affect the polym .
3948	2	3	3	plastic b stretch the most out of all of the plastic . to improv thi lab the student should give a specif weight to add so it is the same for all test should make a specif length for the plastic .
3949	2	0	0	in conclus t wa mostli longer than t becaus t had more higher measur than t . on wai thi student could of improv is he could of put heaven weight . anoth wa he could of done it wa he kept reduc the tape size .
3950	2	3	3	base on the student data plastic b stretch the most with mm for trial and mm for trial . these student could have improv in a lot of thing . first off thei could have been more specif in their experiment design . thei could have been more specif and told how the weight of the weight wa . thei could have also ad more trial to get a better result .
3951	2	3	3	conclus the stretchiest plastic wa type b . improv thei could of had more than on two trial and thei could have ad the origin length of the plastic in their result . to know that all the plastic were the same length .
3952	2	1	1	the conclus that b is the stretchiest and a is the least . two wai s the student could have made hi experi better wa test the dip is the plastic and the width .
3953	2	2	2	base on the data we discov that plastic type b stretch the most after minut of the weight on it with a total of mm stretch . p two wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretch the other wai would be to have on or two more trial to elimin ani chanc of error .
3954	2	3	3	a . plastic type b wa the stretchiest plastic stretch mm in t and mm in t . plastic type a wa the least stretch and onli stretch mm for t and mm for t . p b on wai to improv the experi would have been to add a trial with a differ set of weight . second the experi valid is off becaus there were no state constant . the plastic start length weight ad and condit like weather should be the same for all trial .
3955	2	3	3	a . plastic type b is the most stretchabl with an averag of . mm of stretchabl . the least most stretchabl had an averag stretchabl of . mm less than type b of mm . p b the student could have specifi a singl start length for each trial of each type of plastic . p the student could have specifi the weight to add .
3956	2	1	1	well fro thei could have name the plastic . the second wai is to name why thei ar do it and final thei could have measur it wa befor thei start test .
3957	2	0	0	t had stretch more than trial t for plastic type a b . then is wa lower than t then plastic type d wa exactli the sam .
3958	2	1	2	a i can conclud from the student data tabl that plastic type b had the most stretchabl . the weakest type of polym wa type a . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design wa leav the weight on for longer than five minut or done more trial .
3959	2	1	1	a plastic type a stretch the most mm and type d did not . stretch at all . p b all plastic start at the same length . make sure the temperatur is the same .
3960	2	1	1	polym type c wa the strongest plastic with onli a differ or mm in two trial . thi student could ve list the start length of the plastic .
3961	2	3	3	accord to the student s data plastic b stretch the most with an averag of . mm . plastic d wa the second most flexibl becaus it stretch an averag of mm while plastic c wa the third most flexibl plastic becaus it stretch an averag of . mm . lastli plastic a stretch the least with an averag of mm . howev these result ar not valid . in order to make them valid the student would need to us plastic that ar the same length and us the same weight to stretch . thi would ensur valid result becaus it would be guarante the same size plastic wa be pull with the same forc .
3962	2	3	2	a my conclus would be that plastic b stretch the most becaus it had the farthest length s both time . p b thei should have put weight to make the weight even on the other side . thei should ve also done more trial on the other type of wrap .
3963	2	2	2	. a plastic type b stretch out the most between the two trial with plastic type d come on close . p b . the student could ve made a third trial to be more valid or allow the weight to hang more than min instead it could ve been min .
3964	2	1	1	a accord to thi investig the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch . p the experi is not veri valid due to the follow we ar not awar of what each plastic type is . also more trial should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial . two trial is not enough .
3965	2	0	0	two wai could have been improv is by do group and thei need a hypothesi to know whether their question wa right or wrong s conclus is the plastic type a and d there us becaus thei might have putter more weight on differ type for the second trial .
3966	2	2	2	a conclus about thi student data is plastic type b stretch the most . two wai the student could have improv the design or valid of result is thei should have said if the weight had to be the same mass . thei could have also told the type of tape to us becaus some tape hold up more heavier thing than other type do .
3967	2	1	1	. a plastic a and c have veri similar ina tip base on the amount thei stretch and likewis with plastic b and d . p b the entir procedur is vagu and contain no actual number . on wai thei could have improv would be if thei specifi the amount of weight thei us to get thi result thei got and the wai just to help the peopl try to re perform thi experi thi experi would would be to specifi which plastic ar done at which time .
3968	2	2	2	in conclus to plastic that had the most stretchabl wa plastic a . it is the most flexibl becaus the chang the most from trial to trial . it chang by mm . the student could have improv on there experi by ad more trial to . increas valid and compar the plastic from befor the weight were put on . we don t know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight thei us .
3969	2	2	2	a plastic b d on the second trial had the most stretch than the other plastic a c . p b by do it time instead of . trial and show the differ for exampl b on the the second trial stretch more than d by .
3970	2	2	2	a a conclus that i can draw from the student data is that plastic type b stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least . p b two wai the student could have improv their experiment design is on thei should have state what four type of plastic thei were us . secondli thei should have said the amount of weight thei put on the clamp .
3971	2	2	2	a . in conclus plastic b wa the on who stretch the farthest in both trial . p b . could have had trial . also could have under control .
3972	2	2	2	a . plastic type b stretch the most and plastic type a stretch the least . p b . the student could have test each type of plastic for sever differ time . he also could have done more trial with each type of plastic .
3973	2	3	3	accord to the result shown on the tabl i can conclud that the plastic type b is the most stretchabl . type b stretch the most at mm . type d stretch mm while type c stretch mm . type a onli stretch mm . there ar mani wai that the group could have improv their design . on thing the could have shown is the initi length of the plastic . also the group could have shown how much weight thei ad to the clamp . thi would allow me to reproduc their experi and compar result .
3974	2	1	1	a plastic b wa definit the most stretchi and of all the plastic . p b he could have record how much the plastic stretch at certain interv of time mayb everi minut . he also could have test both plastic each to back . the same wai twice in trial .
3975	2	1	1	a plastic type b had the most stretchabl . p to improv the valid of the result the student could have measur the plastic time on each trial .
3976	2	2	2	as the type of plastic chang from type a all the wai to type d the amount of stretch increas from mm to mm . p thei could increas the amount of trial and make all plastic start length the same .
3977	2	3	3	a in conclus plastic type b wa stretch the farthest for both trial and plastic type a had the least amount of stretch . p b the student could have improv their experi s by ad more trial and tell us the specif amount of weight us for each plastic .
3978	2	2	2	base on the student data plastic type d ha the most stretchabl . to valid the result the student could have done a third trial and averag the three length for each plastic . thei could have also specifi how much weight wa ad and keep that consist .
3979	2	0	0	two wai that the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result the first would be to figur out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date tabl . the second wai would be to write down the averag of the t and t . a conclus base on the student s data is which plastic stretch the most .
3980	2	3	3	a . overal plastic type b had the most stretchabl amongst all of them . p b . done more trial to compar with result . b check length and other measur to see if thei ar correct .
3981	2	3	2	thi polym investig lack numer data . i can lab make a solid conclus . p the student can improv the late by sai the origin length of the plastic and the end length . thei can also sai how much weight thei ar us and what plastic thei ar us .
3982	2	2	3	the student did a good job conduct thi experi . there wa an indec variabl the type of plastic and there were multipl trial . the weakest plastic wa b becaus it stretch the most and the strongest wa a becaus it stretch the least . p on wai the student could have improv thi experi would be by us the same amount of weight that wa stretch the plastic . anoth wai could be by draw a line on the plastic so thei would measur it in the same spot start and end .
3983	2	2	3	a in conclus it clear to see by look at the data that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . p b the student could have improv the experi design and valid of the result if thei would state that thei us the same type of weight for each plastic . in addit thei should have document the length of type of plastic befor begin the procedur .
3984	2	1	1	a plastic type a had the highest stretchabl while plastic type d had the lowest stretchabl . p b . sai the exact measur of the plastic sampl in step to make them all the same so that the start mm of the plastic would be a constant . p . have a control group on piec of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edg .
3985	2	2	2	the conclus would be that type b plastic stretch the most for both trial on and two . type d made no chang it stretch the same amount for both trial . on wai thei could have fix their experi wa record what the length of the plastic wa befor the stretch and the chang of it . anoth on wa to explain the differ type of plastic were .
3986	2	2	2	a plastic type b show the most stretchabl becaus t it stretch and t it stretch . plastic type d stretch mm in t and t . plastic type c went from mm in t to mm in t . lastli plastic a went from mm in t to mm in t . thi show that plastic b is the most stretchabl . p b the student could have shown the initi weigh of the materi and should have had the materi on start of the same length .
3987	2	2	2	base on the student s data i can conclud that plastic type b wa the most stretchabl . p a wai that the student could have improv the experi is by do or trial instead of . also by let the plastic hang for minut but also minut .
3988	2	0	0	from the data of thi lab i can infer that in the second trial plastic type a and b both stretch farther than thei did in the first trial . and type c didn t stretch as much as if did in the first trial and type d stretch evenli with what it stretch the first trial . two wai thei could have made thi procedur better is by do the experi on the same surfac and by have the same person conduct the experi in both trial .
3989	2	2	2	the polym that ha the most stretchabl wa plastic type b with mm for the first trail and for the second . plastic type a had and type c had and type d had and . on wai the student could of improv their experi wa to do three trail .
3990	2	1	1	overal plastic type a stretch the most . therefor it must be weaker than the other . on wai thi experi could be improv is sai repeat experi for plastic b c and d . thei did not mention other plastic . anoth wai their experi could be improv is that the student could add anoth trial to prove their result correct .
3991	2	2	1	a conclus i can draw for the stretchabl for polym plastic is that for plastic type b the stretchabl must be real stretchi becaus for the t it wa mm and for t it wa mm . but for type c it stretchabl went down t mm and t mm . p the student could of improv the design by ad a t . also thei could of us more than just four differ type of plastic .
3992	2	1	0	that each plastic bag doe stream a littl bit . why he could of improv is how much weight he put on it . he could pistol us differ type of clamp . on last thing he could of chang is how light he hung the bag from the floor .
3993	2	0	0	base on the student s data plastic tube d stretch the most for t and t both try wa the same number . last type a for t and t ha the lowest stretch amount .
3994	2	1	1	a mt conclus base on the student data is that plastic b had the more affect for it stretchabl . plastic a had the least stretchabl when it come to the weight of clamp on top of the bag . p b two wai the student could have improv their experi is by includ what type of plastic and how long do we leav the weight on top of plastic .
3995	2	3	2	base on the student data plastic a wa stretch the least at an averag of mm . plastic b stretch the least at an averag of . m . after that came a plastic d with mm follow by plastic c at . mm . the student could have improv the experiment design and it valid by do a rd trial also the student could have state whether or not the plastic start off at a constant length for all u .
3996	2	1	1	thei could of repeat all the step over .
3997	2	3	3	a conclus that can be drawn base on the student data is plastic type b is more stretchabl than the other becaus in t it stretch mm and t it stretch . the other plastic didnt stretch as far as plastic b . two wai the student could ve improv the experiment design and or valid of the result is did a third trial and measur how far the plastic wa on the edg of the tabl .
3998	2	3	3	a . in conclus the plastic that stretch the most wa plastic type b at and mm . the plastic that stretch the least wa plastic type a at and mm . p b . on wai to improv thi experi is to add constant like how mani weight and how much do thei weigh . also thei should do anoth trial and then averag out the result .
3999	2	2	2	a in conclus plastic type b is a better polym plastic for stretchabl due to the fact that the first trial is stretch mm and the second trial it stretch mm . the polym plastic that stretch the least wa plastic type a . the first trial is stretch mm and the second trail it stretch mm . p b on wai thei could have improv thi experiment design would be by ad a certain amount of weight . and anoth wai thei could improv it and prove it valid would be with a control .
4000	2	3	3	base on the student result i can conclud that plastic type b is the most stretchabl . in the data plastic type b stretch to mm on t and mm in t . none of the other plastic had stretch as much . then wai to improv thi experi is to add anoth trial and averag the data . also the student need to tell exactli how much weight he clamp to the plastic .
4001	2	2	2	a a conclus that can be drawn from thi experi is that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . b wai the student could have improv the experiment design is by includ how much weight to put on the clamp and the type of plastic us .
4002	2	2	2	a plastic type a stretch longer than all other type in other word it ha more stretchabl . type b c have the same stretchabl and d ha the least stretchabl had the least durabl keep it s structur while the other did not . p b made all the type start out in the same length . specifi the amount of weight that wa appli record the length of the sampl befor stretch it .
4003	2	2	2	base on the student data some of the plastic stretch some stai the same and on of them even got smaller . on wai thei could have improv there experi is have the plastic all the same size . anoth wai thei could improv thi is by sai how much weight thei put on and keep the weight the same for all .
4004	2	3	3	a base on the student s data plastic type a is the least stretchabl while plastic type b is the most stretchabl . plastic type b and c fall in the middl of these two in term of stretchabl b wa more stretchabl than c . p b on wai the student could have improv the experi would be cut all of the sampl to uniform length and width rather than simpli measur what their length alreadi wa . the student also could have specifi how much weight wa be ad to each sampl .
4005	2	1	1	a plastic type d seem to be more accur of stretchabl becaus after both trial t and t the amount stretch is the same at mm . p b on the experi could be prove is to repeat the experi . a second wai is to make an hypothesi befor start the experi .
4006	2	1	1	a is not much of defer of t to t is onli or mm so is realli acut . b thei shout have more plastic type and more trial .
4007	2	2	2	a . a conclus that can be made is that thei us plastic b then plastic b will stretch the most . p b . more trial and us more plastic type .
4008	2	2	2	the conclus i draw to thi investig is plastic type b as the most stretchabl compar to all the other and plastic a as the least stretchabl . p two wai the student could ve improv thi experi would be a clear with the for exampl how much weight and also mention what type of materi need to conduct thi experi .
4009	2	2	2	well as we see on
4010	2	0	0	the conclus it draw from thi is that thei .
4011	2	1	1	plastic type b wa the stretchiest plastic type . it list watch a total of mm plastic type d wa second it stretch a total of mm plastic c wa the rd stretchiest it stretch a total of mm and plastic a wa the least stretch it stretch a total of mm .
4012	2	2	1	conclus the stretchabl of a type plastic is depend on what type of polym it is . plastic a and b were clearli strong than plastic c d most like thei were made of veri differ polym . p the student could have improv their design by specifi the weight and us the same weight and clamp everi time . thi would ensur more precis .
4013	2	3	3	a a conclus i can draw by look at the student s data is that the type b plastic stretch the most after the two trial . p b the two wai these student could have improv their wa by ad more trial . also thei should have establish a start length of the plastic .
4014	2	2	3	a in conclus plastic b wa the most stretchabl at an averag of mm while plastic a wa the least stretchabl at an averag of mm . p b the student could have known the weight of the clamp and add that on to the amount of weight ad . also thei could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic .
4015	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch most d second most c third most and a stretch the least make b the most stretchabl and a the least . b on wai to improv the experiment design and or valid is to tell which type of plastic thei us anoth is to tell how much weight thei ad in the clamp .
4016	2	2	2	plastic type b wa the weakest and stretch the most a wai to improv the experi would be to design what each type of plastic is and how much weight to us on the clamp .
4017	2	2	2	a after review the data i have figur out that plastic type b for both trial the plastic stretch the longest . trial mm trial mm plastic type b is the least chang . b wai thei could of improv there experi is do a control with all plastic type with the same weight for all of them . also thei could of hang each plastic for differ length of time do trial on of minut of .
4018	2	1	0	base on the student data after put the weight over clamp the amount of stretchabl decreas and the differ the between the trial went down on by on . student could of improv the experiment design by weigh the weight and calcul how much pleasur would be on the clamp . thei also could of said the specif plastic sampl thei were us .
4019	2	2	2	a base on the data show plastic type b wa the stretchiest materi and plastic type a is the least . b in there data tabl thei could have given how much weight wa appli the the materi . in the procedur the student could have been more specif on the unit us and elabor more on perform the procedur to make it easier for the next person to us it and under stand .
4020	2	1	1	a on the trial a b c and d stretch quiet long and plastic b is the most longest so plastic b is the best from all . on the second trial the result is not a lot differ from the first trial plastic a b and c stretch . mm more and plastic d still the same . b student should put the origin measur for all the plastic and put in the data tabl . the student should leav the weight on the clamp to hang there longer than minut to see if those plastic could stretch even more .
4021	2	0	0	the student would had said what type of plastic thei us and if thei were the same and sai what wa the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic stretch .
4022	2	3	3	a a conclus that could be drawn base on the student data is that plastic type b can stretch the most with t be mm and t be . and plastic type a stretch the shortest with t at mm and t at mm . p b the student should have made sure that all plastic strip ar the same length and the student should have tape all the step in the same spot .
4023	2	3	3	plastic type b stretch the longest out of plastic a c and d . on the first try stretch mm and the second time stretch mm . to make the experi better the student should have done the experi a coupl more time becaus plastic type d stretch mm both time . the second wai he or she could make it better is by tell how much weight he ad on the clamp .
4024	2	3	3	a . accord to the student s result type b plastic wa longer in length and stretchabl . plastic a seem to be the least stretchabl but onli at a length of mm . p b . the student could have been to sai how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variabl . also the student could have put the initi length of the plastic with the result to see which plastic had stretch the most .
4025	2	1	1	a . after time the maximum stretch of a palmer goe down and becom stronger . p b . he could of made the ladi longer of tell how much wait you were ad .
4026	2	3	3	a . base on the find the stretchiest plastic is type b stretch mm in t and mm in t . the least stretchi would be type a stretch mm in t and in t . p b . . thei need to specifi the size of the plastic sampl for exampl in in . if thei weren t all the same size the result would be inaccur . . thei also need to specifi the weight without it on sampl could stretch more have pound on it than on sampl with onli pocket on it .
4027	2	3	3	in conclus plastic type b had stretch the farthest . the two type were both pretti constant with ie new have peni . a wai thi student could have improv thi wa by tell us how what the origin measur the plastic type wa . therefor we could see how much it s stretch . i think these type could have done anoth trial to make the experi a littl more valid .
4028	2	1	1	a i conclud that the it plastic test show some increas in length when stretch . i believ that the plastic wai that thei were stretch increas in length over to me that what i found in thi experi . p b i believ thei should have identifi the differ plastic . i also believ that thei should of said how much weight the plastic wa hold and mani . that what should of been ad .
4029	2	2	2	with the data record . i know that plastic type b is the most it stretchabl of the four plastic type i test . p it would of been wise to state what the plastic were for and how much the weight s weigh .
4030	2	0	0	the student is conclus is a student perform the follow investig to test four differ polym plastic for stretchabl and the two wai the student could is the student not talk procedur polym and attach a clean to the bottom edg on the plastic sampl .
4031	2	0	0	in conclus in the st trial all of the plastic here higher . in the second trial plastic a increas by mm plastic b increas by mm plastic c increas by mm and plastic d stai the same . i believ the amount of plastic stretch in the second trial depend on the type of plastic .
4032	2	2	3	a plastic type b wa the most stretchabl plastic us becaus it wa stretch longer than ani other plastic in both trial . plastic type a had the least stretchabl with mm for the first trial and mm for the second . p the student could have improv hi her experi by keep these two variabl constant would make the experi veri reliabl .
4033	2	0	0	in the second trial the length for plastic a and b went up . for plastic c the longer length wa in the first trail . but in plastic d the amount stretch stood exactli the same . two wai the student could have improv thi experiment design is draw a line graph and give the data tabl a littl more detail .
4034	2	2	2	a base on the student data i ve conclud that plastic b wa the stretch plastic . p b the student could have improv the design by ad a control group and ad more trial .
4035	2	2	1	in conclus plastic type d stretch the most out of the sampl . plastic a on the other hand wa the least stretchabl . p the student could ve specifi the type of plastic thei were test . thei also should have specifi the amount of weight thei were ad to the clamp . thei didn t sai how to measur the length of the plastic type .
4036	2	1	2	base on the student data i can conclud plastic type b wa the stretchiest polym . the student could have improv there experiment design by tell us the type of polym plastic thei us and thei should have indic in the graph how much weight wa us on each type of polym to stretch it out .
4037	2	2	2	overal plastic a is the most durabl . plastic b wa the weakest in both test . thei could have improv their experi by have there trial for more data . thei could have ad more weight in the second trial .
4038	2	0	1	the conclus im gonna draw base on the student data is that there amount of stretch mm could go up if thei keep investig . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result is that first take a sampl of on type of plastic and measur it length . and second repeat the procedur exactli for the remain three plastic sampl .
4039	2	2	2	the amount that plastic type a stretch wa mm on the first trial and mm on the second trial . plastic type b stretch mm then mm the second time . plastic type c stretch mm first and mm second . plastic type d stretch mm both time . to improv thi lab thei could have made on more trial averag the result . thei could also specifi on the weight thei were us to make the result more interest .
4040	2	3	3	a base on the student data i can conclud that plastic type a stretch the least . it is the strongest of the four becaus it onli stretch an averag of mm averag from the two trial while b s averag stretch wa . mm c s averag stretch wa . and c s averag wa mm . b . thei should have specifi the amount of weight . thei should have specifi the size and shape of the plastic .
4041	2	3	3	a . plastic type b stretch the most with mm and plastic type a stretch the least with mm . p b . two wai thei could have improv the experiment design is by have all of the plastic be the same length in the begin and ad a certain amount of weight not just sai add weight .
4042	2	0	0	the student could of improv their experi by let it stretch a littl longer or add anoth clamp to the plastic sampl .
4043	2	2	2	a i can conclud that thi experi wa not valid . thi student onli had two trial instead of three . p b thi project could have been valid if the student had three trial and if thei had kept their control group constant .
4044	2	2	2	a plastic type b stretch the most becaus it stretch an averag of . mm . plastic type a stretch the least becaus it stretch an averag of mm . plastic type c and d ar in the middl . p b add weight to the clamp befor thei put it on the plastic . specifi exactli where the clamp should be place on the plastic .
4045	2	1	1	a a conclus base on the student s data is plastic type a produc the most amount of stretch from trial to trial mm to mm compar to all the other plastic type . howev plastic type d remain the same and on on of the plastic type c the amount it stretch decreas from to . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design of the result ar instead of us on type of plastic thei should have us variou type to broad the result . also the student could have done more trial .
4046	2	3	2	a base on the student data i conclud that plastic type a wa the least stretch out and that plastic type b wa the most . p b two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and or valid of the result is by on keep the amount of weight ad to each type of plastic constant and two make sure that the weight of the clamp wa subtract .
4047	2	0	0	plastic type a wa the onli type of plastic that stretch the most . the student could of improv the experi design by have two measur devic . also thei could of us heavier weight .
4048	2	1	1	the student could have impair the experi by do the amount mani time to check if it wa accur .
4049	2	1	2	a . a conclus base on the student data is that the stronger the plastic that thei us is the harder it is to stretch . for exampl sampl a and c must be thicker becaus it stretch less . p b two wai the student could have improv the experi wa by actual put the same amount of weight on each and by sai the name .
4050	2	2	2	polym b is the most stretchabl plastic . p the improv the experi the student could have mass the weight us in step to us the same amount of weight to the plastic in the second trial than the first trial .
4051	2	3	2	base on the student data result plastic type d stretch the most . plastic type a stretch the least . two wai the student could have improv the experiment design and valid of the result ar that thei should of measur how long each piec of plastic wa befor thei ad the weight so thei can know how much the plastic stretch . also thei should of us the same amount of weight .
4052	2	1	1	a accord to my result plastic type b had the greatest amount stretch with mm in trial on and in trial with mm . i would reli on plastic type b to hold my thing . p b st wai the student s could have made their result valid better on instead of put plastic type a b c d thei should have label them by what plastic thei were . nd the student should have seen how far the plastic could stretch befor break .
4053	2	3	3	a in conclus plastic type b had stretch the most in both trial on and trial two . plastic type a had stretch the least amount in both trial . p b the student could have ad how mani weight thei put on the plastic and how much each weight weigh . thei should have ad how long the plastic wa befor it wa stretch .
4054	2	3	3	conclus plastic type b test to stretch the longest length compar to the other three sampl . p . there is no control in the start length of the plastic . differ size of sampl can invalid the experi result . p . the amount of weight attach to the clump should be held constant . plastic type b which stretch the longest could have had more weight on it than the other .
4055	2	3	3	a conclus on could draw is that plastic type b ha the most stretchabl . a student could improv the design and result by ad more trial and specifi how much weight should be ad . these two suggest would durastiali improv the valid of the result as well as improv the design .
4056	2	0	0	a base on the data plastic a c show a decreas of or mm of stretch . plastic d is a reason plastic to be us as stretchabl . p there s no need for improv for the experi design or result .
4057	2	1	1	base on the student data plastic type a and b in trial did better than trial but c d of trial did better than trial . on wai the student could have improv the experiment design or valid of the result wa to measur how can the tabl wa that the weigh were hang off the plastic with . anoth wai the could ve done better wa to test the trial again to see more result .
4058	2	0	0	b we need materi thei ar plastic tape clamp it show that it wa the lab of polym plastic . p hypothesi if we attach a clamp to the bottom edg of the plastic sampl then weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minut and remov the weight measur the length of the plastic becaus repeat the procedur exactli for the remain three plastic .
4059	2	3	2	plastic type b wa the most stretchabl . it stretch on averag . mm while the other did not stretch past mm . the student could have improv the experi as design by includ the averag and us trial instead of on . also if on made all the plastic the same length . on could accur determin which wa the most stretchabl .
4060	2	1	1	a . after test thi experi the result show that plastic sampl d stretch the most mm make it the weakest plastic . plastic type a appear to have stretch the least amount of mm make it the strongest plastic . b the student could have made thi experi more valid by ad a control group . thei could have also done a trial in order to increas the valid of their experi .
4061	2	3	3	a we can conclud that plastic b is the most stretchabl from all the type but the lab is not valid becaus judg by the result the lab wa not done the same for each trial . p b . two wai to improv thi lab ar have s or third trial at least state the weight of the product us to put on the plastic materi .
4062	2	2	2	a . on conclus i have fro thi data wa that plastic d wa the weakest and stretch the most . p b . on wai thei could have improv thi experi is to make sure all sampl size ar the same length and make a chang if thei arent . anoth wai is by specifi how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ampl .
4063	2	0	0	. the second trial is not exactli the same as the first trial caus in the second trial even type plastic goe up but on stai the same . thei could of improv the experi design by make sure everi thing is in order make sure to everi type of plastic sampl you do the same to it .
4064	2	2	2	a i have conclud that base on the student data that plastic type stretch the most amount of millimet and plastic type a stretch the least amount of millimet . p b two wai the experiment design could have been improv ar that a control should have been ad to that experiment off at and includ how much weight wa ad to the clamp .
4065	2	2	2	plastic type b stretchabl most mm in t mm in t . plastic a stretch the least at onli mm t and mm t . thi experi isn t exactli valid howev becaus stretch the materi time usual make it stretchier the second trial . henc the mm stretch in t wa usual greater for all plastic . instead you should have of each plastic to ensur valid . also thei could have had a trial to see the result came at the same .

24743	9	2	1	the author separ the articl into differ part . there ar four main part . there ar three main part each with a differ topic on space junk . in the first the author us a numer approach like it s a . . . tool bag but then move to a more seriou tone . the author explain that it is a seriou issu . the author present the danger and problem in the later section . final at the end he sai how mani nation contribut to the problem and it must be solv . so first he get your attent then the next section explain what it is and the last two present the issu and the serious of it while conclud the paper .
24744	9	0	0	by give insight on the problem then give solut .
24745	9	1	1	he talk about the histori of space and how we have satellit . then talk about the import of satellit debri and how it can be veri danger .
24746	9	0	0	the author start out gentl and sai the fact straight out . the author start to get veri harsh and start to state that thi is a seriou matter . the organ of thi articl not onli help keep a ey on it but it help to tell us about thi and what will happen to stuff in the atmospher . from go to gentl and eas us into the more pain fact wa a great wai to write thi articl .
24747	9	1	1	he start of with a attent letter and goe into the serious of the essai . then he explain how these thing happen and show just becaus thei ar small doesnt mean thei ar not effect .
24748	9	0	0	he put it import .
24749	9	2	2	the author organ the articl into sever section the intro what is space junk crash cours and littl bit but a big deal . the first section defin space junk for the reader . section two explain how debri can be form by collid satellit and section three explain why space junk is a problem .
25949	10	2	2	black black might affect the doghous becaus then the doghous can get to hot for the dog . know thi becaus in the result black got the hottest .
25950	10	1	1	white white becaus you wouldnt want the dog to get to hot .
25951	10	2	2	white the color white will reflect the sun rai off of it becaus in the lab the color white had the lowest temperatur and black absorb the heat so it wa hotter and if thei had the doghous paint black the dog would get to hot and die . so white
25952	10	1	1	white thi color will keep the doghous cooler insid becaus it doesnt heat up as fast . the averag time for the glass to heat up wa 42 degre in 10 minut .
25953	10	2	2	white i would us alight color like white in thi case becaus if it 95 degre outsid and you have a black doghous the doghous is go to be hot . like in the experi thei us thei us a black lid becaus it would make the jar the hottest .
25954	10	0	1	light grai the darker of color the the hotter it get
25955	10	1	0	light grai i think it will affect it by the doghous attack heat and if need thei could paint it anoth color when it get colder of warmer
25956	10	1	1	black the color would absorb more heat from the sun make it hotter in the doghous
25957	10	1	1	light grai i chose light grai becaus i wa think of temperatur of the season . in summer the light grai will reflect some of the heat while keep it littl warm insid in winter the light grai will absorb littl of the sunlight make it littl warm insid .
25958	10	2	2	white it will keep the doghous cool and not to hot becaus in the tabl a black lid had an averag of 58 degre and the white lid had an averag of 42 degre . there for if the doghous wa paint a darker color the doghous would get to hot insid .
25959	10	2	2	black the black color doghous would be warmer on the insid . the averag temperatur with the black lid wa 53 deg the averag temperatur for the dark grai lid wa 48 deg . the averag temperatur for the light grai wa 45 deg and for the white it wa 42 deg . there is a 11 deg differ between the black and white color lid . so the black doghous would have the most heat on the insid .
25960	10	0	0	white the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflect the light from the lamp in the experi .
25961	10	1	1	white it would reflect a lot of the light and heat make it cooler insid the doghous .
25962	10	1	1	white it will give the dog more cool air becaus lighter color absorb cool air instead of heat
25963	10	1	0	black well the darker the lid is the more temp azur goe into the jar . and the averag of the black lid wa 53 deg c .
25964	10	0	1	white thei would want to choos white for the summer becaus it wont attract a lot of heat . thei would want to us black for the winter to attract more heat
25965	10	0	1	dark grai all chop sabl color ar what you might call a doubl edg sword becaus although the dark color will keep the dog warm in winter it ll make him to hot in summer . and while the light color will keep him cool in summer thei wont do much for him in winter .
25966	10	1	1	black it will keep the insid of the doghous warmer
25967	10	1	0	light grai light grai is the best color to us becaus itself is that dark of a color so the dog wont burn up darker color increas in heat temperatur and not that light that the dog would be cold .
25968	10	2	2	white brandi and jerri should us white paint becaus in the experi the jar with the white lid increas the least in temperatur . it increas 18 deg c while the black lid made the temperatur increas 29 deg c . therefor the white paint should be us so that the doghous doesnt overheat .
25969	10	1	1	white the color white would affect the doghous it so it mayb cooler insid becaus of the lack in absorb energi .
25970	10	0	0	light grai on cold dai the light grai absorb the hotter temp . and on hot dai it dous not absorb as much .
25971	10	2	2	white the best color to paint the doghous would be white . white reflect more light than black . thi would keep the insid temperatur of the doghous cooler than it would if the doghous were paint black . in the experi the white lid wa at an averag of 11 deg c cooler than the jar with the black lid . therefor the white would beth best color to paint the doghous .
25972	10	1	1	light grai the doghous should be light grai becaus it doe not absorb to much heat or to littl heat so the dog wont be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25973	10	2	2	white if thei color the doghous white then it will be cool insid and not so hot like it would be if it wa black . becaus when the jar lid wa black the insid of the jar wa 53 deg c and when it wa white the insid of the jar wa 42 deg c
25974	10	1	1	dark grai the air insid will be hotter than it would be with the light grai and white as the roof color so the dog can stai warm at night but it also be colder than if the black wa the roof color so the dog wont get too hot dure the dai .
25975	10	1	2	white the color might affect the doghous just al littl bit becaus the white color had the lowest temp . compar to the black with it averag wa 53 . that an 11 deg c di franc an the dark grei wa an 6 deg c differ . also the light grai wa an 3 deg c differ .
25976	10	2	2	black it will effect the doghous by it be more hot caus on the chart it show black wa the hottest
25977	10	2	2	light grai the light grai color would reflect some of the light energi but also absorb a littl so the doghous would not get too hot or cold . the white color had an averag of 42 deg c after 10 minut which might be too cold . the dark grai had an averag of 48 deg c which might be too hot .
25978	10	0	0	black no color will affect the doghous
25979	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai would be a good color for the doghous becaus it would not be too hot insid . if you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter becaus it would absorb more heat . in everi trial for dark grai it creat 48 deg c . thi seem like a pretti good temperatur fora doghous .
25980	10	1	0	black black is my choic becaus if it kept the jar warm for ten minut then black would be abl to keep a doghous warm for longer .
25981	10	0	0	black i chose black becaus the sun wont reflect the color black and it wont effect insid the doghous .
25982	10	1	1	white it will make the doghous cooler
25983	10	0	0	black becaus it so string
25984	10	1	1	white it should be white . the white lid averag wa 42 deg c and it wa the lowest averag of temperatur for the experi .
25985	10	1	1	white the white color reflect the most thermal energi and will keep the dog cool .
25986	10	1	1	dark grai it will make it warmer than alight grei or white doghous but cooler than a black doghous . thi is better becaus dog gener us a doghous to hide from the rain in winter and my color will keep it warmer . howev thei ar also us in summer and as such should not be black as that would make it unus dure summer .
25987	10	1	1	black the black doghous would keep you warmer in the winter but it would be realli hot in the summer
25988	10	1	1	white the color will keep the doghous cool on the insid soon hot summer dai the dog can be nice and cool
25989	10	2	2	black black paint would affect the doghous by make it the warmest becaus accord to the data black had the highest averag of temperatur which wa 53 deg c which is warmer than the other 3 test color . soto me i think black would beth best color .
25990	10	0	0	light grai i chose light grai becaus it wont make the dog feel sad .
25991	10	2	2	light grai the light grai color would keep the doghous mild and warm . on averag the light grai color lid went from 24 deg c to 42 deg c a differ of 21 deg c . compar to the black color lid which went from 24 deg c to 53 deg c a differ of 29 deg c which is too hot . or the white color lid which went from 24 deg c to 4 2 deg c a differ of 18 deg c . therefor a grai color roof would be perfect fora doghous .
25992	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous nice and cool nice accord to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar coolest .
25993	10	2	2	black the black on will have a good heat for the dog becaus in the trial the black lid wa averag wa 53 deg c .
25994	10	1	1	white the color of the doghous will affect the temperatur of the insid of the doghous . the color white will keep the t temperatur lower than the other color .
25995	10	2	2	light grai i think white would beth best color for the doghous becaus accord to the experi it wa the coldest so in the summer when it is hot outsid the doghous will not be to hot .
25996	10	1	1	white brandi and jerri should paint their doghous white becaus the color absorb less heat so it will keep it cool and not too hot for the doggi .
25997	10	1	1	light grai it wont be to hot on sunni dai and it wont be to cold on cloudi dai .
25998	10	2	2	white white would beth best color for the doghous becaus it would keep the dog cooler . white would absorb less solar and thermal energi therefor lower the temperatur within the doghous . in the experi the air temperatur in the jar with the white lid averag 42 deg c while the black lid jar averag 53 deg c . the light grai lid produc and air temperatur of 45 deg c and the dark grai lid made the air temperatur in the jar 48 deg c .
25999	10	2	2	black black will make the doghous warmer insid becaus darker color absorb more energi . and in air temperatur the averag temp . for black wa 53 deg while the averag for white wa 42 deg . everi start temperatur start at 24 deg therefor black would beth best color to choos for the doghous .
26000	10	2	2	black black will beth base color for the dog you es becaus . in the chart lid color vs . air temperatur insid glass jar black shade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3 . dark grai light grai and white wherein the low to high 40 s . black will keep the doghous warm or cool when need .
26001	10	1	1	light grai the color light grai will affect the insid of the doghous becaus it will get warm but not too hot becaus if you have a doghous that is wai to hot the dog might die and sinc doghous ar alwai out in the sun the doghous will becom extrem hot becaus in the experi the lid color were onli left under a lamp for about onli 10 min and the temperatur went up veri quickli .
26002	10	2	2	white us white paint would be a great paint color for the doghous becaus if it white it wont receiv that much sunlight and so it would be cooler . if you look at the data tabl it would show you that when it ha white paint it is below 45 deg c so white would be a great doghous color .
26003	10	1	1	white becaus white doe not absorb as much energi so it would be cooler in the doghous .
26004	10	2	2	black if brandi and jerri us black then the temperatur will be warmer becaus it ha the highest averag temperatur at 53 deg c . if thei us white then it will be colder becaus the averag when white wa 42 deg c . therefor the darker the doghous the warmer it will be becaus black wa 11 deg c more than white .
26005	10	1	1	white the white color paint might make the insid o the doghous colder than outsid on a hot dai the or she dont get wai to hot .
26006	10	1	1	light grai it would be a good color becaus it wouldnt be too cold or too hot for the dog . it would be just right .
26007	10	2	1	white on a hot summer dai it easi for dog to get overh harm them and even kill them . therefor white is the best color of paint to us becaus the air insid of it onli increas by 18 deg c after ten minut of exposur to light and heat . with black paint it increas by 29 deg c which could definit be detriment to a dog health .
26008	10	1	1	black becaus the doghous will have a higher temperatur becaus black absorb more solar energi which will transform into thermal energi
26009	10	1	0	white i think the doghous should be white becaus it would keep the dog cool in the hot summer sun .
26010	10	1	1	dark grai i chose a darker color like dark grai becaus e it will absorb more energi so the dog will hopefulli much warmer in the winter . howev anoth reason i chose a dark grai instead of black is that it also lighter in color compar to the black and will hopefulli not get too hot in the summer .
26011	10	0	0	white becaus the lighter the color ar the least heat energi is go to be absorb .
26012	10	2	1	light grai thi would affect the doghous becaus some light would be attract to the hous but not too much . in their experi the light grai lid temperatur wa 45 deg . thi would be a good tempt ar for the doghous becaus in the summer the dog would have enough shade so that it would not overheat but in the winter it would be warm enough so that the dog would not be cold .
26013	10	2	2	white white would keep the doghous cooler . white doe attract heat like the color black doe . when start at 24 deg c the black lid jar went up to an averag of 53 deg c . and the white lid jar which also start at 24 deg c onli went up to an averag of 42 deg c .
26014	10	1	1	white i would us white paint becaus it would keep the doghous cooler . the doghous will be cooler becaus the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghous cooler .
26015	10	0	0	white it will affect the doghous by the temp in side becaus the wight attack less height
26016	10	1	1	white i chose white so it would be cool in the summer
26017	10	2	2	white the best color to choos would be white becaus on averag white had the lowest temperatur of all the color mean the insid of the doghous would be cooler
26018	10	1	1	light grai light grai will be that color becaus you could actual what color you ar do like when you paint that hous and mayb in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the hous black .
26019	10	2	2	white accord to the experi in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperatur the color white will keep the insid of the doghous cooler becaus white doe not absorb light .
26020	10	1	1	white it well allow it to be color then be hot .
26021	10	2	2	white it might affect the temperatur insid the doghous . the data show that the white lid ha the lowest temperatur therefor make it the best color to build the doghous with .
26022	10	1	1	white the color white would keep the doghous nice and cool insid ina hot summer dai .
26023	10	2	2	white the white paint should keep the insid temperatur of the doghous cooler on a hot dai than sai black paint for exampl . when compar the averag temperatur of all the lid color the white lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperatur . on averag about 6 . 6 deg c cooler compar with the averag for the other lid . so therefor white paint is the better choic especi if you ar look to keep the insid of the doghous cool for your dog on a hot dai .
26024	10	2	2	white in the experi is state that lighter color ar cooler than darker color . white is averi light color and light c color dont absorb veri much heat so that mean that the doghous wont be to hot .
26025	10	2	2	light grai light grai would be best becaus it would absorb a littl heat but not to much . it averag temperatur wa 45 degre which wa the middl result of the three so in the winter the doghous would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it would keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool .
26026	10	2	2	white if the doghous wa white then when it is hot the doghous would be cooler . in the experi it show that the averag temperatur for the air wa 43 calcium and all the other color made it hotter like the black lid wa 53 calcium .
26027	10	2	2	white white will affect the doghous by make it cooler . in the trial the lighter the color the cooler the temperatur wa .
26028	10	1	1	dark grai dark grei becaus in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold .
26029	10	2	1	black black would be a good color for the doghous becaus black absorb more heat . black absorb more heat becaus it is made of no color so it doe not reflect ani color of light which mean it absorb all the light . in the experi the black held an averag of 53 deg c after be under the lamp for ten minut . the white lid had an averag insid temperatur of 42 deg c after be under the lamp for ten minut . thi is a differ of 11 deg c and is becaus white is made up of all the color so it reflect all color of light wherea the black effect no light .
26030	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous by make it hotter .
26031	10	1	1	white the color i chose white would affect the temperatur becaus white absorb less light make the doghous not as high in temperatur .
26032	10	1	1	white the color of the doghous be white will caus the doghous to stai cooler under sunlight . thi is becaus the color white reflect the light awai from the doghous and the light will not be absorb and turn into heat energi insid the doghous .
26033	10	2	2	black the black would be better to us fora paint color becaus it will make the doghous warmer for the dog becaus in the experi black made the jar the warmest .
26034	10	1	1	black if you us the black then the doghous would stai warm whenev the sun is out becaus the sun would get more light becaus it is darker .
26035	10	1	1	dark grai brandi and jerri should paint the doghous dark grai becaus the temperatur accord to their data is 48 deg c and it perfect temperatur not too cold nor hot and it bare chang temperatur .
26036	10	1	1	white the best color to choos fora doghous is whit becaus it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehydr . the dog will stai cooler insid the white doghous .
26037	10	1	1	white lighter color mean cooler hous .
26038	10	2	2	black the best paint color for the hous would be black becaus it would keep the dog warmer than other color would . the black lid wa 53 deg and all other were between 42 and 48 deg
26039	10	1	1	light grai thi color would effect the doghous becaus it would not be to hot or to cold .
26040	10	1	1	white the color black tend to make thing hotter and so if u us a white lid it would keep the temperatur down if it wa a sunni dai . for the black lid in the experi the temperatur increas temp 54 and for the white it decre temp 42 . thi is becaus the energi is suck out from the dark color . also dog have a lot of fur so it would be best to have a cooler hous .
26041	10	2	2	white i would paint the doghous white . the highest temperatur wa 53 deg for the black lid . which would caus the dog to overheat . while the lowest temperatur wa 42 deg for the white lid . which would help the dog stai cool . so i would paint my doghous white becaus it is 11 deg cooler than paint it black .
26042	10	1	1	white the white is better for the doghous becaus it wont get to hot insid and not to cold . the hottest it would get in the hous is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26043	10	0	0	dark grai i dont think it will effect it becaus it ha the same number for each trial
26044	10	0	0	white i think white is the best color out of all of the chosen here becaus black is not espi to find in the dark but white is espi to find .
26045	10	0	0	black it might blow it up
26046	10	1	1	white thi color is the best becaus it wont attract so much heat energi and it would be fresh for the dog
26047	10	0	0	white it will start like meet old and it wont look like new anymor it will have like scratch and mud and some black thing
26048	10	2	2	white it would be much cooler insid the doghous becaus the color is light and reflect light better . as it said in the result it had the lowest temper of 42 degre calcium
26049	10	2	2	light grai i chose light grai as a good color for the doghous becaus the color doe not absorb as much energi as a darker color such as black . the color black which absorb a lot of energi result in high temperatur in the doghous compar to a lighter color such as light grai that still absorb some energi but not as much and caus lower temperatur . base on the experi the result show that that light grai absorb enough energi to keep the averag temperatur insid the jar at 45 deg c 8 deg c less than black which absorb more heat and caus higher temperatur . therefor a good color option fora doghous would be light grai .
26050	10	2	2	black the darker the doghous color the greater the increas in air temperatur in the doghous becaus the color absorb more energi . in the experi the color black absorb the most energi caus the insid of the jar to beth warmest . the result for black were 54 deg c 52 deg c 54 deg c and 53 deg c . while all the other color that were lighter absorb less energi .
26051	10	2	2	white i honestli would most like choos white becaus all dark color dark grai black light grai the sun just like get it realli hot and all light color white the sun reflect off of it sow white would be best becaus it would keep the dog when it in the doghous white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot dai but that my opinion and that why i would pick white what would u pick
26052	10	1	2	black dark color like black and dark grai absorb more energi and make it hotter than if i us white or light grai .
26053	10	2	2	white it would keep the doghous cooler becaus the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lid did
26054	10	2	2	black the doghous will be warmer . the doghous will be warmer becaus in the experi the black color lid wa the warmest .
26055	10	1	1	light grai thei would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool . the test show that dark or light grai is about 46 . 5 deg c so it will be good for the dog .
26056	10	1	1	dark grai i think dark grai becaus in the summer it wont get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energi to keep the doghous fairli warm .
26057	10	2	2	white how the white paint will affect the doghous is it wont absorb so much heat so the dog wont be as hot . if brandi and jerri were to choos black paint it will absorb all the heat becaus in the experi in trial on it deg c wa 54 in trial two it deg c were 52 in trial 3 it deg c were 54 and the averag is 53 . so these result show that the doghous will constantli be warm so thi will not make the dog comfort with all the heat . while the white lid in the experi had veri low temperatur it deg c were 42 43 41 and it averag came to 42 deg c so thi show that the white will absorb barlei ani heat .
26058	10	2	2	black black would beth best color to paint the doghous becaus it would attract the heat and keep the insid of the doghous warm . accord to the result of brandi and jerri s experi lid vs . air temperatur the black lid kept the insid of the jar warmer than ani of the other color lid . so therefor the black paint would keep the insid of the doghous warmer than ani of the other color .
26059	10	0	0	dark grai becaus that would beth color to choos
26060	10	1	1	white i chose white becaus white is a nice cool te apertur and dog have fur so then thei would be even a littl bit hotter . the reason i know that white would be a pretti good temperatur is becaus in the experi the white lid wa averag to be 42 degre callu and so that is pretti good temperatur for the doghous .
26061	10	1	1	dark grai it might get a littl warm in the daytim but it will keep the insid of the doghous warm in the night .
26062	10	2	2	white the color white would be a great color to us ina doghous becaus the insid of the doghous would be cooler for the dog so when it hot then it wont be to hot in it hous . i sai thi becaus the averag temp of the color white is 42 deg c while the other 3 c color ar abov thi averag temp .
26063	10	0	0	light grai thi could color might affect the doghous becaus the temperatur in the doghous could chang depend on the temperatur outsid the doghous .
26064	10	2	2	white the color white might affect the insid of the doghous by keep it the coolest . the averag for the color black wa 53 deg c the averag for dark grei wa 48 deg c the averag for light grei wa 45 deg c and the averag for white wa 42 deg c . thi show that white is the coolest color and should be us for the doghous to keep the doghous cool .
26065	10	1	1	white if the doghous wa white then when it is hot outsid the dog will be cold and when it is cold outsid the dog ha fur to keep him warm .
26066	10	1	1	white the doghous will stai cool becaus white reflect all the color heat so the hous will stai cool .
26067	10	2	2	black the color black heat the doghous the most . it get to 53 degre calcium in there wherea dark grei 48 degre light grei 45 degre and white 42 degre . so black would beth best color
26068	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai will absorb some heat and keep the doghous warm
26069	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous by heat it up becaus black absorb more energi .
26070	10	1	1	white white wa written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the doghous to be cool when it is hot out .
26071	10	1	1	white the intern temperatur of the doghous will be cooler than a doghous that is color black . thi is onli the case if the extern temperatur ar hot and the dog need a cool place .
26072	10	2	2	white white is the best color fora doghous roof becaus in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghous keep it nice and cool insid for the dog the doghous is for . after all would you want your dog to be uncomfort on a hot summer dai i chose white to beth best color fora doghous roof becaus the averag air temperatur insid the jar with the white lid wa cooler than the air temperatur in the light grai dark grai or black lid jar . with a start temperatur of 24 deg c for each jar after ten minut the temperatur of the air in jar with the white lid had a averag temperatur of 42 deg c while the jar with the highest averag air temperatur of 53 deg c wa the jar with a black lid which mean the jar with the white lid had an averag air temperatur 11 deg c cooler than the averag of the jar with the black lid . which is quit a differ if you ask me .
26073	10	2	2	black the doghous should be paint black becaus then the dog will stai warm dure the winter if he she ha to stai outsid . when the black lid wa us in the experi it wa on averag 5 degre warmer insid the jar than with the dark grai lid 8 degre warmer than the light grai lid and 11 degre warmer than the white . therefor if the doghous is paint black the dog will keep warm much better than if the doghous wa paint dark grai light grai or white .
26074	10	2	2	black have a black doghous will keep the dog warm in the winter becaus the hot lamp experi show that darker color absorb more heat than lighter color .
26075	10	1	2	light grai the darker the color the warmer the doghous would be black warmest 54 deg c . the dog might overheat if the doghous is too hot . the lighter the color the colder the doghous white lowest 41 deg c . thei wouldnt want the doghous to be uncomfort cold . so dark grei or light grei would be best aug . 46 . 5 deg c .
26076	10	2	2	light grai brandi and jerri should paint the doghous light grei becaus the door wouldnt get to hot becaus hi dog hous is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with averi light color sot hat is why thei should paint it light grei becaus it not to light and it not to dark and also the experi tell us that the averag temper rein celsiu for light grei wa 45 deg and for black it wa 53 deg and dark grei 48 deg and for white wa 42 deg light grei is the averag of them all 53 black 48 dark grei 5 53 black 45 light grei 8 and 53 black 42 white 11 light grei 8 is in the middl of both 5 and 11 so light grei is the color thei should paint the doghous .
26077	10	1	1	black it will make the doghous warmer insid
26078	10	2	1	light grai light grai would beth best color for the dog hous becaus it would absorb some heat but would not absorb as much a the color black . if thei chose black thei doghous would absorb to much heat as shown in the experi that after just 10 minut the temperatur of the black lid jar rose 29 deg c but the light grei lid jar onli rose 21 deg c . sinc black absorb so much heat it could caus the dog to be to hot but light grei allow the dog to still have some heat just not as much .
26079	10	1	1	light grai the color would keep the doghous cooler than the dark grei and black color . also it warmer than the white color hous .
26080	10	1	1	black the color black absorb all the color of light so the insid of the doghous would be hot becaus the color is absorb and trap the heat from the light .
26081	10	2	2	light grai dark color make thing realli hot for exampl the black reach up to 54 c white color make thing a littl to cold for exampl it onli reach up to 43 c the color grai would have the perfect affect for insid the doghous to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but wa to hot becaus for exampl the color grai reach up to 46 c at most make it an equal balanc between to hot and to cold .
26082	10	1	0	white white will be better for the doghous becaus it will be more heat effici and will let in less heat . if black wa us it absorb more heat then lighter color would .
26083	10	0	0	black buzz it will effect it cut black is a reli dark color so ah . . . .
26084	10	1	1	black the color will affect the doghous by make the temperatur rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog . also on trial 1 after 10 minut it rise to 54 deg c which is to high the best color to paint a doghous would be white that wa 42 deg c after 10 minut .
26085	10	1	1	white it would make it nice and cool for the dog
26086	10	1	1	white the temperatur insid the doghous will be cooler than if thei us a darker color such as black .
26087	10	2	2	white brandi and jerri would want to paint the doghous light grai . paint the doghous light grai would beth best paint to color the bog hous becaus in the experi thei had found out that paint the hous black absorb more heat energi and paint it white will not absorb en off energi so in the middl will beth best for the dog . so not too much thermal energi but some thermal energi be absorb is best .
26088	10	1	0	white the best on would be white becaus the white on absorb less energi . the black on absorb a lot of energi the averag of the black on wa 53 deg c . averag for the dark grai wa 48 deg c . the averag for the light grai wa 45 deg c and the white wa 42 deg c . the darker the color the more energi it absorb . the lighter the lesser it absorb energi .
26089	10	2	2	white the color white wont attract as much light as the black so the dog wont have to suffer realli hot weather on sunni dai . the white compar to the black is abett choic becaus black color attract more light for exampl it averag a 53 deg c while the white averag a 42 deg c . that is all deg c differ .
26090	10	0	0	black so the dog will stai warm at night .
26091	10	0	0	white becaus it could get dirti or someth .
26092	10	1	1	black i chose black so the insid of the doghous can be warm at about 53 deg c and wont get cold over the time the dog is outsid
26093	10	1	1	white well the color white make it so that insid of the doghous would be more cooler becaus the sun reflect off white and it wont be as hot insid the doghous .
26094	10	1	0	white i chose white becaus the darker color absorb more heat energi that the lighter color
26095	10	2	2	black i believ that the best color for the dog hous would be black especi in the winter becaus it will keep the insid of the doghous warm becaus the darker the color of the object the greater increas in air temperatur insid the object accord to the data tabl in hot lamp so the darker the color the warmer the hous or object .
26096	10	2	2	white accord to the result the lighter the color the colder the temperatur is . sinc white had less heat thei would want to paint the doghous white .
26097	10	2	1	black if the doghous is black then it will be warmer . i know thi becaus the jar with the black lid had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c
26098	10	2	2	white the color white would keep the doghous the c coolest temperatur . on averag the color black is 53 deg c dark grei is 48 deg c light grei is 45 deg c and white is 42 deg c .
26099	10	1	1	black thi color will keep the insid of the dog hous warm dure winter becaus dark color absorb more heat energi .
26100	10	0	1	light grai light grai might affect the the doghous by keep the insid colder for the dog .
26101	10	2	2	white by paint the doghous white the insid of the doghous will be cool accord to the result of the experi . the data show that when the lid wa black the air temperatur wa warmest and when the lid wa white the air temperatur wa coolest . therefor paint the doghous white would creat a more comfort temperatur for the dog .
26102	10	1	1	light grai becaus light grai is in between hot and cold so the doghous wont be to hot for him to stai in or too cold for the dog to stai in black be hottest and white be coolest
26103	10	1	1	black black will mack it hot in the doghous becaus the lap is hide black and black attack heat
26104	10	0	0	light grai light grai would be a great color fora doghous . although it can still caus an affect . the light grai color can caus the doghous to not have the right temperatur insid . the result would be that if the color wa light grai is would be about a good temperatur insid the doghous . like in trial 1 in the jar the temperatur wa 44 in trial 2 the temp . wa 45 trial 3 it wa 46 as the temperatur . the averag wa 45 so with that said the light grai color is good enough becaus the averag temp . is not as bad and it wouldnt be so dark insid .
26105	10	2	2	white white . it is the color of all the other in the experi with the lowest averag temperatur rise of 18 deg c . in the experi the start temperatur of wa 24 deg c and after ten minut under a lamp the air insid the jar increas by 18 deg c . total of 42 deg c . if black wa chosen to beth doghous color it will not be suitabl for the doghous becaus the averag temperatur rise would be too high .
26106	10	2	1	black the darker the lid color the greater the increas in air temperatur
26107	10	0	1	black the wood will be hot
26108	10	1	2	white white would beth best becaus then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it wouldnt get as hot as black dark grei or light grai .
26109	10	1	1	white the white paint would keep the insid of the doghous cool in the sun becaus it reflect the most energi therefor have the lowest intern temperatur .
26110	10	2	2	white white would beth best paint color for the doghous . in the experi the temperatur in the jar for the white lid averag 42 deg c . the black lid jar averag a temperatur of about 53 deg c . the dark grai lid jar averag 48 deg c and the light grai lid jar averag 45 deg c . the white lid jar wa the coolest out of the four .
26111	10	1	1	black it will be warmer insid of the doghous .
26112	10	2	2	dark grai the best paint color for the doghous would be dark grai . in the experi of the glass jar it had an averag of 48 deg c and wa the second highest temperatur . the highest temperatur wa the black lid with 53 deg c . the differ of the highest temperatur and second highest temperatur wa the 5 deg c . if us the dark grai paint color it would still absorb energi to keep the dog warm but yet be a bit cool for them too .
26113	10	2	2	white white becaus it will keep the doghous at a cool temperatur about 42 deg c in the summer when the dog is outsid and need a rest .
26114	10	1	1	black thi color would affect the doghous becaus the black would absorb energi from the sun and make the insid of the dog hous hotter then the rest of the color
26115	10	1	1	light grai with alight grai doghous the temperatur insid the hous would be cool in the summer but warm enough forth e dog in the winter . with thi balanc in temperatur you dont have to worri about the dog be uncomfort dure ani season .
26116	10	1	1	dark grai it didnt get ani hotter or cooler therefor it is the best paint color for the doghous becaus the dog would not be too cold nor too hot .
26117	10	1	1	light grai light grai is more as cooler than black or dark grai in the summer but black and dark grai will be warmer in the winter light grai or white . mean light grai is in the middl .
26118	10	1	1	white in the hot summer month the doghous wont get too hot .
26119	10	1	1	black the darker the color is the more hotter it is go to be in the insid and as in black what i pick it is go tow arm for the dog to sleep at night .
26120	10	0	0	light grai becaus it stai at a liveabl temp . of 45 degre .
26121	10	0	1	white if thei paint the doghous white then when the dog goe insid it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there .
26122	10	2	2	dark grai the dark grai will keep the insid of the doghous warm enough in the winter and not to hot dure the summer . the dark grai wa an averag of 48 deg c which is not as hot as the black lid which wa an averag of 53 deg c and not as cold as the light grai which wa and averag of 45 deg c .
26123	10	0	1	black the color mai affect it by the temperatur of the air mayb cooler than the other color
26124	10	1	1	white the white color will attract less energi than the other thu make the doghous cooler
26125	10	0	0	white the color would affect the paint hous becaus . if it is a black color hous . it will be super dark . if it wa a white color hous it would be more lighter . dure nighttim
26126	10	1	1	light grai becaus you dont want the doghous to be to cool or to warm .
26127	10	0	1	white the color on the outsid will either heat up or cool down the doghous and sinc white wa still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghous .
26128	10	0	0	black the color might affect the doghous by attract the heat to it
26129	10	1	1	light grai i would choos light grai becaus then the dog wont be too hot or too cold . thi is why i would choos light grai to paint the doghous .
26130	10	1	1	white thi color will sure make the doghous much cooler . i am not sure whether the question is ask which on will keep the dog cool or hot so i am choos white . thi color will keep the dog cool when it is hot and sunni . howev thi color will not keep the dog warm in the winter so i am not sure .
26131	10	0	0	white the color that might affect the doghous is the white becaus it wa the on that got less then the other three color
26132	10	2	2	light grai light grai would beth best choic becaus you dont want the doghous to cold but you dont want it to warm . and the averag temperatur for the light grai wa 45 deg c which is just right fora dog becaus you dont want your dog to get to hot . and the black wouldnt be a good color becaus darker color absorb more energi . and there wa an eight degre differ between the black lid and the light grei lid make the light grei lid the cooler better choic .
26133	10	2	2	white white is a good choic becaus it will absorb less heat . the experi show that white is the least absorb of heat so it will keep the doghous cooler .
26134	10	2	2	white brandi and jerri should paint the doghous white . thi is becaus white doesnt attract as much heat . i know thi becaus in the previou experi the averag temperatur for the white lid wa lowest at 42 degre celsiu . us white paint will caus the dog to not be too hot .
26135	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai will make the doghous a bit warmer . the data state that it is 48 deg c alwai .
26136	10	1	1	white white reflect more sun keep the dog cooler in the summer heat .
26137	10	1	1	light grai light grai wont absorb too much sun in which case heat the interior and it will absorb enough heat on cold dai to warm insid .
26138	10	2	2	dark grai i choos light grai becaus it had an averag temperatur of 45 which is right in the middl of temperatur and thee effect will be warm and cool at the same time . when you look at the tabl of the result from the experi you will see that light grai had an averag of 45 so that is perfect temperatur becaus it will not get too hot and it will not get too cold .
26139	10	2	2	white i think white would beth best color to paint the doghous . i sai thi becaus white absorb less energi make the doghous cooler . in the experi the white on averag wa 42 deg c and that wa the coolest temperatur . the warmest temperatur of the air insid the jar wa the black with 53 deg c . fora dog insid a doghous i think it shouldnt be hot for the dog that s why i chose the color that made the doghous the coolest .
26140	10	1	1	black the black wood paint would effect the temperatur more becaus the darker a color the more energi in attract . so the black on would be hotter than the white on .
26141	10	0	0	light grai if the color ar light grai than the dog hous the doghous will be cooler begun of the grai and it also be warm cut it light . . .
26142	10	2	2	white the doghous will not be to hot . the temperatur will rise but it will not rise a lot it will stai in cool for summer and thei wouldnt have to worri about the doghous get to hot . white is the on that stai the coolest and the heat didnt rise a lot it stai about the same temperatur the whole time .
26143	10	2	2	black in my opinion brandi and jerri would want to paint the doghous dark grai becaus it had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c which is the second hottest temperatur out of the four lid color . i think dark grai would beth logic color to paint a doghous becaus dure harsh weather it will keep the dog warm but dure the summer it wont be to uncomfort hot like black mayb .
26144	10	1	1	black thi color would help keep the insid of the doghous warm becaus the data ha prove thi . thi would help dure winter .
26145	10	1	1	white usual a doghous is onli us in the summer soto keep the dog a littl less cooler thei should us a white paint . by i learn that all the color bounc off white and go somewher els along with their heat . but black ha all the color so it absorb all color and their heat . so white would be best in the tabl it show that the averag tempt ar fora white hous is 42 deg c . the averag temp futur for light grai is 45 deg c the averag temp . for dark grai is 48 deg c and black averag temp . is 53 deg c . that an 11 deg c differ . white could be veri import .
26146	10	1	1	white the color would affect the doghous becaus the lighter the color is the cooler the hous would get . if the doghous wa black then the doghous would be too hot .
26147	10	1	1	white the color will heat up the doghous to about 42 deg c in 10 minut . thi is the best color to choos becaus the black heat up to 53 deg c in 10 minut . therefor the temperatur oft he white jar wa 9 deg c lower than the black jar make the white cooler .
26148	10	1	1	light grai the doghous should be light grai becaus that wai the air temperatur isnt to hot or to cold it just about in the middl .
26149	10	1	2	white the color would affect the temperatur insid the doghous . the black would make the temperatur insid the greatest then the dark grei then the light grei then final the white would have the lowest temperatur just like the lid color . for the lid color black had an averag of 53 deg c the dark grei had an averag of 48 deg c the light grei would have an averag of 45 deg c and the white had an averag of 42 deg c so the temperatur for the doghous would be close or be to the same as the temperatur of the jar .
26150	10	2	2	white choos the lightest shade white is the best color to paint a doghous becaus in order to creat an environ most comfort for the dog year round the doghous must be capabl of stai cool all summer . paint the hous white will ensur that it stai as cool as it can over summer thu make it the most comfort for the dog . the white hous will remain coolest becaus as accord to the data collect the averag temperatur will be apron . 42 deg c while for the other color thei reach much greater temperatur 45 deg grai 48 deg grai 53 deg black . the white color wa 11 deg cooler than the darkest color black thu make it the best color to paint a doghous .
26151	10	0	0	dark grai keep it cooler
26152	10	2	2	light grai alight grai color could give you less heat in the summer but dure the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth . sinc in the experi the black lid would get the most heat you wouldnt want a dog to get to hot but also not to cold .
26153	10	0	0	black caus he might not want to sleep in the doghous caus of the color of it and it might also mess the dog ey up tot hat could also be it in thi experi
26154	10	1	1	black it would make it realli hot insid the doghous becaus the color black attract more heat as pose to color that ar veri bright like white or light grai or light green even .
26155	10	1	1	black paint the doghous black might affect it by attract all the heat to it and might caus the dog to have a heat stroke while is lai insid .
26156	10	0	0	black black becaus black goe with everyth
26157	10	2	2	white thi is the best paint color for the dog hous becaus in the experi it prove that the white materi absorb the least amount of heat therefor make the temp . in the jar the least
26158	10	2	1	white i would choos white becaus it is on of the lightest color . also in the experi it wa proven that white stai the coldest after 10 minut . therefor in the sun it should stai fairli cold fro the anim live in it .
26159	10	1	1	black the doghous should be paint black becaus black absorb heat . learn thin when the data tabl show that the averag temperatur for black wa 53 deg c . when the dog out at night you would most like want it to stai warm .
26160	10	1	1	white becaus in the summer the doghous count get overh becaus the averag for the white lid in the hot lamp experi wa 42 deg c and the black wa 53 deg c .
26161	10	2	2	light grai the color chosen will affect the insid of the doghous becaus the color is a factor for the amount of air temperatur it attract . from the experi black attract the most heat or air temperatur with an averag of 53 deg c and dark grai had an averag of 48 deg c light grai had 45 deg c and the color white with 42 deg c on averag . base on these result i think light grai is the best paint color fora doghous sinc it still attract a certain amount of heat fewer than darker color but from the averag air temperatur in the glass jar from the experi the air insid the doghous would be more withstand abl than that of black paint or dark grai which would attract even more heat . therefor light grai color paint would beth better option fora doghous .
26162	10	0	0	black ha the most averag .
26163	10	2	2	black i think thei should us a black for the doghous becaus sinc we live ina gener cold area and the black paint would help keep the dog warm at night with the averag temp of the air when the area is black is 53 deg c
26164	10	1	1	light grai light grai would keep the doghous a bit warmer without make it too hot like the black and dark grai would .
26165	10	1	1	dark grai dark grei is best becaus in the winter the doghous will absorb heat . also in the summer the doghous will not absorb be too much heat . like if it wa black .
26166	10	1	1	light grai it make the doghous a littl cool but not too hot becaus on hot dai it should be cool for the dog togo in there and rest . on colder dai the dog should be abl togo in there and still be a littl warm .
26167	10	0	0	black it would attack heat or georg frame the sun
26168	10	0	0	dark grai it will becom light in there becaus if you have dark grai it will infect the color from the outsid
26169	10	1	1	light grai the hous wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middl
26170	10	0	0	white .
26171	10	2	2	black i think black would beth best color for the doghous . it will attract more heat insid the doghous than ani other color becaus in the experi with the jar the black lid jar had the warmest insid temperatur . thi black doghous will heat up the insid of the doghous for when it is cold out . when it is warm outsid and the dog get hot it can sleep outsid .
26172	10	1	1	dark grai it had a steadi temperatur and for outsid it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof wa paint dark grai .
26173	10	2	2	white if the doghous wa white the insid of that doghous would keep the temperatur insid cool becaus like in the experi the color white onli got an averag of 42 deg c . unlik the color black which got an averag temperatur of 53 deg c .
26174	10	0	1	white less heat will be attract to it .
26175	10	0	0	dark grai
26176	10	1	1	light grai it will be warm fora dog that is meant to be outsid and cool dure summer
26177	10	2	2	white i have chose the color white becaus it had the least highest temperatur . in the data from the previou experi the white lid had an averag temperatur of 42 deg make it the least hottest .
26178	10	2	2	white white would make doghous cooler i know thi becaus when the lid color wa white the averag wa 42 deg c compar to the averag for black with the averag is 53 deg c .
26179	10	2	2	black black would beth best color becaus it would keep the hous warmer . in the experi black produc the highest temperatur insid the jar 53 deg c
26180	10	2	2	light grai it would absorb a littl amount of heat fort he summertim when it hot . but becaus it also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter . i know thi becaus the black lid absorb the most heat and the white lid absorb the least heat .
26181	10	0	1	white becaus it reflex the light
26182	10	2	2	black black would kept the doghous the warmest becaus of the averag of all the other were black 53 dark grai 48 light grei 45 and white 42
26183	10	1	1	black the doghous would be to hot sinc darker color absorb more energi .
26184	10	0	0	black that color would affect the doghous becaus it would be too dark in the insid and dog dont have ey color so it would be hard for the dog to see . it also take wai longer to dry then the other color the other color dri in the 40 s but the black color dri in the 50 i would not recommend them to color it black
26185	10	1	1	light grai in the summer it will not absorb much heat keep the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amount of heat keep the dog at least fairli warm .
26186	10	1	1	black the color would affect the doghous becaus the dark will help the dog go to sleep better dure the dai . also it will affect it becaus the darker the color the greater the increas in air temperatur in the doghous . it will also affect it becaus the darker color absorb more energi .
26187	10	2	2	black black is the best color for the doghous in order to keep the do hous warm . brandi and jerri s data show that the darker the lid orin thi case doghous the darker the color the more increas in air temperatur . which in the lid experi the data show that black on averag had the highest data of 53 deg c while other like dark grai and light grai had averag of 48 deg and 45 deg c .
26188	10	2	2	dark grai the dark grai will affect the temperatur of the doghous just enough that the anim that s live in it wont freez or overheat becaus the dark grai color in the experi didnt collect as much heat in the experi as the black so it wont overheat the the anim and it collect more heat than white or light grai so the opposit effect wont take place .
26189	10	1	1	light grai light grai would keep the temperatur in the summer down so the dog wont overheat . black dark grai would be to hot in the summer the dog would overheat white would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freez . that is why light grai would be perfect for the doghous color .
26190	10	2	2	white i would choos white becaus it would make the insid of the doghous cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldnt have to be super hot in the sun . the averag temperatur for white wa 42 deg after ten minut and it wa 53 deg for black show that black make it hotter insid .
26191	10	2	2	light grai light grai will affect the doghous by keep it cooler than it would with black paint but warmer than it would with white . in warmer temperatur the paint will not absorb as much sunlight so therefor the insid of the doghous will not be as hot . the black paint had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c while the light grai had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c . that is a differ of 8 deg c . the light grai will keep the doghous cooler but it will also keep it a littl bit warmer than white paint . the white paint had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c . the light grai paint would keep the doghous 3 deg c warmer then the white paint but 8 deg c cooler than the black paint .
26192	10	0	0	white white will bring more light in the doghous becaus it is alight color and it attract light and it will bring more in
26193	10	2	2	black black becaus it well make the dog hous warmer and the result to the black cooler is sai it warmer .
26194	10	1	1	light grai the doghous would be cooler in the summer and not as cold in the winter the light grai lid wa cooler than the black lid which would make it better for us ina hot environ . the most comfort color vari with the kind of environ and i am assum thi is a rather warm environ .
26195	10	2	2	white the best answer would be white becaus white is alight color that wont absorb heat and dehydr the dog dure the summer . when brandi and jerri perform their experi thei found that when ajar had a black lid on it the temperatur insid the jar wa ana averag of 53 deg c . wherea when there wa a white lid on the jar thea averag temperatur wa 42 deg c . that is an 11 deg differ . there for the best choic would be to paint the doghous white .
26196	10	2	1	white how the white might affect the doghous is becaus it will be a lot cooler than the other dark color becaus the averag temperatur of the darker color ar more then white
26197	10	1	1	white it might not give it much light from the sun or ani heat becaus darker color attract more energi and light . just like with the jar and the lamp . the jar with a black lid had the highest averag therefor prove that darker color attract more energi .
26198	10	1	1	white paint the doghous white will reflect the sunlight make it cooler in there
26199	10	2	2	black well darker color absorb more heat than lighter energi so if you paint the doghous black than the insid of the doghous will be warmer than the insid of a white paint doghous . when brandi and jerri us a black lid dark color for the experi the result were in the low 50 s rang 52 54 deg c . but when thei us the white lid light color the result were in the low 40 s rang 41 43 deg c .
26200	10	1	1	light grai in the summer the doghous will not be hot
26201	10	0	0	dark grai the dark grai will affect the doghous becaus no matter what color the dog hous is the room will still be dark .
26202	10	1	1	dark grai the doghous will be warm dure winter sot hat the dog will warm and comfort
26203	10	2	1	white thi color will help the doghous cool becaus it is the color that remain the coolest dure the experi .
26204	10	1	0	light grai i would go with light grai becaus in the experi it wa at a good temperatur of 45 deg f black wa to hot at a temperatur of 53 deg f dark grai wa a littl to warm at a temperatur of 48 deg f and white wa a littl to cold at a temperatur of 42 deg f .
26205	10	2	2	black if brandi and jerri were to paint a doghous the color thei should choos is black becaus it the darkest color so it absorb the most thermal heat . my theori is correct becaus in brandi and jerri s hypothesi the darker the lid color the greater the increas is air temperatur in the glass jar becaus darker color absorb more energi .
26206	10	0	0	white us the color white to paint the doghous would make the doghous beth lowest increas in air temperatur then the other color . the doghous start at 24 degre for each trial . the doghous would be about 42 degre and i know that becaus the first trial wa 42 degre the second trial wa 43 degre and the third trial wa 41 degre . the averag temperatur is 42 degre so therefor white is the best color to us .
26207	10	1	1	white it would make the doghous cooler insid
26208	10	1	1	white if you paint the doghous white it will be c color insid than if you paint it black . sinc black absorb more energi it will get hotter faster than if it wa paint white .
26209	10	2	2	white thei should us white becaus in the other ex present white wa the coolest so if thei us white it will not get to hot in the doghous .
26210	10	2	2	light grai the color of the doghous should be light grai becaus it doesnt absorb as much energi as black and dark grai which had the temperatur of 53 deg c and 48 deg c in the experi so the dog wont feel veri hot either and sinc dog ar alwai jump around thei probabl alreadi ar hot enough . also if it doe get cold light grai will still absorb enough energi to keep the dog warm becaus it temperatur wa 48 deg c which is onli 2 deg c less than dark grai so i think light grai will beth best color for the doghous .
26211	10	0	0	black becaus the lighter on top put on the doghous is the white not the black becaus it a differ of nine .
26212	10	2	2	light grai the color white might affect the doghous becaus the air temperatur on the insid would be a lot cooler but not too cold and at the same time not too hot . when the lid color of the glass jar wa black the averag air temperatur wa 53 deg c after onli 10 minut when the start temperatur wa 24 deg c which i believ might be too hot fora dog live ina black doghous . when their wa a white lid the averag temperatur after the same amount of time and start at the same temperatur of 24 deg c wa 42 deg c which i believ would be too cold fora dog live ina white doghous . i believ the light grai lid air temperatur wa neither too hot nor too cold becaus after 10 minut and a start temperatur of also 24 deg c it averag air temperatur insid wa 45 deg c .
26213	10	1	1	white white is the best color for the doghous becaus lighter color absorb less energi which is shown on the data chart . it ha an averag temperatur of 41 deg c versu the black lid which ha an averag temperatur of 53 deg c .
26214	10	1	1	dark grai dark grei would be good becaus it wont get to hot or to cold for the dog becaus the averag temp for dark grei wa 4 8 deg c
26215	10	1	1	light grai it will cool and heat up the doghous
26216	10	1	1	white it will make it less hotter for the dog
26217	10	1	1	black if it wa color black it would make the dog hous hot .
26218	10	2	2	white white would make it cooler insid for the dog becaus it would reflect more heat instead of take it in . also it wa cooler insid becaus white averag wa the lowest 42 deg .
26219	10	2	1	white i think thei should paint the color white becaus white absorb less heat than black doe . becaus if black dark grai or light grai were to be paint on the doghous that would absorb more heat than white would .
26220	10	1	2	black if you paint the doghous black the insid of the doghous would be warmer than if you paint the doghous a lighter color such as light grei or white .
26221	10	1	1	white white paint will make the doghous less hot becaus it attract less energi from the sun .
26222	10	1	2	white white would beth best color to paint a doghous becaus the light color soak in less light than darker color . brandi and jerri s experi found that ajar with a black lid wa 53 deg c after ten minut but ajar with a white lid wa onli 42 deg c .
26223	10	0	0	white the doghous will be warm when the sun hit it but it wont be so hot and it will be closer to room temperatur forth e dog .
26224	10	2	2	black when the jar had a black lid the averag temperatur after 10 minut wa 53 deg when the lid wa white the averag temperatur wa 42 deg becaus the black lid made the jar warmer the doghous roof should be paint black to keep the insid of the doghous and the dog warmer .
26225	10	1	1	black now the doghous can be warm in the winter becaus dark color absorb more light and then the dog can just plai around in the yard in summer becaus everyon usual enjoi sun even dog .
26226	10	2	2	black by paint the doghous black the air insid the doghous will be warmer than if the doghous wa anoth color . in the experi the air from the jar with the black color lid wa 53 deg which is 2 deg higher than the dark grei lid 8 deg higher than the light grei lid and 11 deg higher than the white lid air temperatur . thi show that the black paint would make the doghous warmer than the other color paint would make it .
26227	10	2	2	white it would make it less hot by have white becaus white is alight color and doe not conduct that much heat as have bin shown by brandi and jerri the result were that white had the lowest averag at 42 deg c
26228	10	1	2	black i choos the color black becaus it keep in more light and it ha hotter temperatur . all the other had lower temperatur and the black wa the highest temperatur .
26229	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai mai attract more heat to the dog hous but no as much as black .
26230	10	2	2	dark grai the best color for the doghous is dark grai becaus it wont be so dark that it will overheat the insid of the doghous and it will also retain it temperatur longer throughout the night . the dark grei averag temperatur after 10 minut wa 48 deg . that is better than the 53 deg averag for the black and the 45 deg averag for light grai becaus it will not be wai too warm but it will retain it heat .
26231	10	1	1	black the color black would effect the insid of the doghous becaus darker color absorb more heat keep the dog warm . as in the experi while the black lid wa over the thermomet and the light wa 5 centimet awai the temperatur on the thermomet increas by 29 deg c .
26232	10	1	1	dark grai doghous will not to hot or cold in summer and winter
26233	10	1	1	light grai light grai would work best becaus then insid the doghous it would still be warmer than outsid but when it wa hot outsid it would not be too much hotter insid oppos to if the dog hous wa paint black .
26234	10	2	2	black with the color black as the doghous the insid temperatur will be much hotter than the temperatur of the other color becaus the averag temperatur for black on the experi wa 53 deg c for dark grai av . temp . wa 48 deg c for light grai it wa 45 deg c av . temp . and for the white lid the av . temp . wa 42 deg c . control variabl temp . in jar befor start ex . respond air temp . insid jar after 10 min . under lamp manipul lid color
26235	10	1	1	black the black color absorb more energi so when it cold outsid the insid can heat up by the sun
26236	10	1	1	black if the doghous is black it will increas the temperatur of the air insid the doghous make it warmer insid it .
26237	10	1	1	light grai it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be hous of the color that it not to dark and not to light so it will keep it ic and cool not to hot or not to cold
26238	10	2	2	white the reason thei should pick white is becaus it will cool down the temperatur in the doghous the reason i know that is in the data thei did for the experi it tell you that white is cooler than the rest of the color
26239	10	1	2	black if a doghous wa paint black then the dog hous would stai warmer insid becaus the experi show that the air temperatur ina glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te matur of 53 54 and 52 .
26240	10	2	2	white thi color will keep the doghous rather cool that wai the dog will not overheat itself . in the experi lighter color absorb less light and were cooler in temperatur .
26241	10	2	2	light grai the light grai color might affect the insid of the doghous becaus if it isnt to dark or to light the insid wont be to hot or to cold . thi is becaus dark color absorb more energi and light color reflect energi . the light grai wa about in the middl with 45 deg c so i thought it wa the best choic for the dog .
26242	10	2	2	white white will beth best color for the doghous becaus the white lid kept the jar coolest mean that white paint will keep the doghous coolest becaus it reflect more energi than ani oft he other color . the white lid kept the jar an averag of three degre calcium cooler than ani other color .
26243	10	1	1	white if brandi and jerri dont want the dog to get to hot then thei would want to pick white becaus it doe not increas the air temperatur as much as black
26244	10	2	2	black i think black would be best to us for the doghous becaus on winter night when it get cold out the black color of the doghous will keep it warmer . sinc darker color absorb more energi than lighter color . black wa 53 deg c after 10 minut while white wa 42 deg c that is a chang of 11 deg c warmer then the other .
26245	10	1	1	dark grai thi color will keep the doghous warm sinc it will probabl be outsid and it wont be to hot either .
26246	10	2	2	dark grai the dark grei would keep the doghous warm but not too hot . thi is shown in the experi when dark grei wa these cold warmest color .
26247	10	0	0	dark grai the color of the doghous will hang the air pressur insid
26248	10	2	2	dark grai i believ that dark grai would beth best paint color for the doghous . although the temperatur insid the do hous would be warmer it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat . also the air wouldnt be too cold that the dog would freez at night when he sleep in it . consid that dark grai had an averag of 48 deg insid it appear perfect compar to the white with an averag of 42 deg and the black with an averag of 53 deg .
26249	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai would be best to build a doghous becaus it the temperatur stai the same everi singl time which mean if it cold the temperatur stai the same . if it hot the temperatur stai the same and doesnt get to hot .
26250	10	2	2	white white would caus the insid of the doghous to not be so hot on the insid so the dog can stai cooler becaus with the white lid the insid of the jar wa the coldest out of all the other jar .
26251	10	1	1	dark grai the temperatur insid the doghous will be warm .
26252	10	2	2	white thei should us the white color becaus white doesnt heat up as fast . after 10 minut white temperatur wa 42 deg while black wa 53 deg . that is an 11 deg differ . so the doghous will stai cooler if the doghous is paint white .
26253	10	2	2	white the color white is best for the doghous becaus the experi wa on the effect of differ lid color on the air t temperatur insid a class jar so look at the chart the color white had an averag of 42 deg c which mean that the increas of air wa cooler . so the color white will affect the doghous by the increas of air flow and be cooler then ani other color .
26254	10	2	2	white the white doghous would not attract as much heat as the darker color so if thei want to keep their dog at a cool temperatur then thei should go with the white color . the averag temperatur for the black color jar is 53 deg c . the averag temperatur for the white color jar is 42 deg c . the black live jar is 11 deg c higher than the white live jar .
26255	10	0	0	black it will usual alwai be 53 deg c in the doghous becaus that is the averag temperatur .
26256	10	1	1	light grai the temperatur of the doghous with alight grai paint coat on it would make the doghous warm but not cold or hot of a temperatur of around 45 deg celsiu .
26257	10	0	0	light grai the dog will might sleep on the doghous .
26258	10	2	2	white the white attract the least heat than ani of the other color . the white low data for white wa 41 deg and the high data wa 43 deg .
26259	10	2	2	white the white would keep the doghous nice and c fool in the experi white attract the least heat . exampl the averag heat wa 42 for the white and 53 for the black .
26260	10	2	2	white paint a doghous white will keep it cooler than other color . in the experi white had an averag temp of 42 deg c while black had a 53 deg c averag
26261	10	2	2	white white would beth best color to paint the dog hous . in the experi white didnt absorb that much heat stai at a temperatur of around 42 deg . thi would mean that the dog hous would stai a cool temperatur for the dog .
26262	10	2	2	white the white paint will beth coolest paint choic for the doghous . in the data brandi and jerri collect white had the lowest temperatur averag of 42 deg c . the next coolest wa light grei with an averag of 45 deg c dark grei with an averag of 48 deg c and the hottest wa black with an averag of 53 deg c . therefor white paint will make the doghous the coolest .
26263	10	1	1	black sinc black absorb more light than the dark grai light grai and white it will make the doghous warmer . thi will help becaus in the winter when he need the doghous the most it will keep him warm when he is insid of it .
26264	10	2	2	white white would beth best paint color for the dog hous becaus on a hot dai the dog wont get as hot . thi is becaus from the result it wa that white paint got as high as 43 and black got as hot as 54
26265	10	1	1	light grai light grai would affect the doghous by keep it slightli warmer in the winter and cool in the summer .
26266	10	2	2	white it would keep the doghous cooler especi in summer month when there ar high temperatur outsid ex in the experi the averag temperatur of white wa 42 deg the coolest temperatur of them all . thi would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overh .
26267	10	2	2	white if the doghous is white then it will be cooler . sinc the white lid made the insid of the jar 42 deg c and the black lid made the insid of the jar 53 deg c then we know that white will make the doghous cooler .
26268	10	1	1	black by make the doghous black it would abov heat energi that will make the doghous warmer than if it wa a lighter color .
26269	10	2	2	white white would affect the doghous by make it cooler and not so hot . thi is becaus in the experi the black absorb the heat so it would be hotter so make it white accord to the data will make the doghous cooler
26270	10	0	0	white white would make it more comfort for the dog and it would be warmer than black becaus the black absorb more energi than light color .
26271	10	1	1	white if the doghous wa paint white then thea ir temperatur insid wouldnt chang veri much . it would be cooler .
26272	10	2	2	black the insid of the doghous would most like beth hottest becaus the black absorb the sunlight therefor it would becom hot on the insid . result from the experi ar that the black lid had a high of 54 degre calcium and that is higher than the rest of the color .
26273	10	1	1	dark grai accord to the result that thei got thi c color remain constant thought all 4 trial . thi mean that if thei us thi to color the doghous the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it will remain a averag temperatur of 48 deg
26274	10	0	0	white decreas the te matur
26275	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous cooler insid be case white attract less energi than black dark grei and light grei . the white wa the lowest averag temp at a 42 deg c
26276	10	1	2	white if thei paint it white then the doghous wont absorb much heat . in the experi the averag temperatur ina white lid jar wa 42 deg c
26277	10	0	0	light grai the dog might not be abl to see it in the night .
26278	10	1	2	light grai if it wa black and it wa summer the dog would be hot . and if it wa white and it wa winter the dog would freez . so light grai would beth best color for the dog . if the temperatur wa 24 deg outsid and the dog wa cold he could go in hi doghous and it would be around 45 deg degre in hi doghous . so he wont freez as much ash would as if he wa outsid .
26279	10	2	2	white the black paint made the air in the jar 53 degre while the white paint wa onli 42 degre . the white paint would be best for the doghous becaus it would keep the doghous cooler if it wa hot outsid .
26280	10	1	1	black thi color might affect the doghous becaus when the sun shine the sun in black then the temperatur will rise from the doghous and make the doghous hot .
26281	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous the coolest becaus the other color got temperatur of 53 deg c 48 deg c and 45 deg c but the white jar got 42 deg c .
26282	10	2	1	white thi would make the doghous cool in the summer becaus in the experi the white lid jar had th coldest temperatur of 41 deg c .
26283	10	2	2	dark grai the doghous wouldnt be too cold or too hot it would be right in the middl . black which is 53 c averag would be a littl too hot and white which is c would be too cold so the on im the middl which is dark grai would beth best paint color for the doghous .
26284	10	0	0	white the white might let sunlight come in the doghous
26285	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous becaus when is sunni and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it en hotter in the outsid and the insid of the doghous
26286	10	1	1	white white is best for the doghous becaus if it wa black the doghous would get hot
26287	10	0	0	black black will affect the doghous becaus dark c color absorb more energi .
26288	10	2	2	white by choos the color white brandi and jerri s doghous would be colder than if thei chose ani of the other color option . in the experi the averag temperatur for black lid wa 53 deg c for dark grai 48 deg c for light grai 45 deg c and final for white 42 deg c . which mean that the white doghous would be colder than ani of the other color option .
26289	10	2	2	light grai i chose the color light grai . light grai would make the doghous around 45 deg c averag on the insid . the result show that light grai wa an averag of 45 deg c and black wa an averag of 53 deg c . white wa an averag of 42 deg c . light grai is 3 degre warmer then white and 8 degre cooler then black . light grai is a color in between the temperatur leav the doghous not to hot or not to cold .
26290	10	1	1	light grai would make it warm in winter and not boil hot in summer .
26291	10	2	2	black the other color had between 40 deg and 50 deg but black is hotter then the other color .
26292	10	0	0	light grai black could turn the insid of the doghous to hot fora dog to be in it so i choos light grai becaus the heat it attract will make the insid nice and warm ten minuet it would onli be 45 deg compar to the black were in ten minut it would be deg which would clearli be to hot fora dog .
26293	10	2	2	white white becaus white reflect the sun and the doghous wont get hot like it would if you us black . in your data it show that in the trial white will beth least hot color .
26294	10	1	1	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus the darker the color the more heat it attract . for exampl dure the winter the dog insid the doghous might get cold so the sun shin on the doghous will absorb the heat and let the heat insid . but sometim the dog might not want so much heat so i pick dark grai instead of black . also anoth exampl is in the summertim if the dog doesnt want togo outsid and stai in the doghous he doesnt have to be so hot . but he can also goo outsid if the doghous is to warm .
26295	10	1	1	black black becaus then in the winter when it get cold whatev sunlight there is it will absorb the heat and make it slightli warmer
26296	10	2	2	white us white paint would keep the temperatur insid of the doghous low on a sunni dai . the averag temperatur of the white lid wa 42 deg c and the averag temperatur of the black lid wa 53 deg c the white lid wa 11 deg c cooler then the jar with the black lid
26297	10	1	1	light grai it will keep it warm for those cold night and keep it cool for those hot summer dai .
26298	10	2	2	black us a black paint color for the doghous will make the doghous nice and warm fora dog dure the cold season when a doghous is need the most . due to the data a black lid color had an averag of 53 deg c . that will affect the doghous by make the doghous much more warmer in temperatur . a white lid onli had an averag of 42 deg c make it too cold for the dog . that s why a black doghous is best fora doghous to keep the dog warm .
26299	10	2	2	white white would beth best paint color becaus it doesnt attract as much heat as black light grai or dark grai becaus it the lightest color . thi is good becaus in the summer if the doghous attract a lot of heat the dog could overheat and get sick . the black lid got the hottest air temperatur have an averag of 53 deg c dark grai wa the second hottest have an averag air temperatur of 48 deg c light grai had the second coolest air temperatur on averag be 45 deg c and white had the lowest air temperatur with an averag of 42 deg c . these result show that the white lid attract the least amount of heat and is therefor why i believ that a white doghous would be best .
26300	10	0	0	dark grai the doghous will be warm but it will probabl alwai stai around the same temperatur becaus in the trial dark grai wa alwai 48 degre calcium
26301	10	1	1	light grai light grai would not affect that much in the insid of the hous becaus when it warm the dog would not be too hot and when it too cold the dog would still be abl to be warm . as you can see in the data collect if thei choos black color to paint the doghous amp it wa hot the dog which could harm the dog and if it thei paint it white around winter the dog would be freez so i believ that light grai would be perfect becaus it doesnt affect the insid of the doghous as much as the other color .
26302	10	1	1	white i would sai black becaus it export be heat to make it worm insid . and thei said the dark the color the greater the air temp futur in the glass jar
26303	10	2	2	white if you paint it white the doghous will be cooler in the hot summer sun . in the experi the averag temperatur for the white lid wa 42 deg but it wa 53 deg for the black lid . you probabl dont want your dog to overheat so you would paint it white .
26304	10	0	0	dark grai it will keep the doghous interior at an averag temperatur
26305	10	2	2	white white would affect the insid of the doghous becaus it is alight color so it will absorb less energi becaus the darker the color the more energi it will absorb . in the data tabl from their experi black absorb the most energi and white absorb the least energi so that is why thei should choos white for the doghous
26306	10	0	0	black the best paint color for the doghous would be black becaus the darker the doghous the grater chanc it will have out in the sun
26307	10	2	2	white the best color would be white becaus white had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c compar to the other temperatur . white would keep the doghous the coolest temperatur possibl .
26308	10	0	0	black black will effect the doghous a lot in the summer becaus black is an energi color .
26309	10	1	1	white thi color will affect the doghous by make it colder . if thei live ina hot place thi would beth best color to c hous from .
26310	10	2	2	white i think that brandi and jerri should paint the doghous white . i believ that white would beth best color becaus in the result it show that white collect less heat and energi . that would d be good becaus if it wa sunni and the dog want togo somewher cool he would have hi white doghous that doesnt suck in all of the heat .
26311	10	2	1	dark grai the best paint color for the doghous would be dark grai becaus it will wont get to hot or to cold in the doghous for the dog . i know thi becaus in the result the light grai lid onli made the jar an averag of 48 degre c after 10 minut of be under the lamp .
26312	10	2	2	light grai light grai will keep the doghous cooler that black becaus lighter color reflect more light than darker color . dark color do not reflect light well instead thei absorb it caus higher temperatur . in winter light grai will keep the doghous slight warmer than white would and it will keep the doghous cooler in the summer .
26313	10	0	0	light grai it will heat the doghous up just enough to be the perfect temperatur .
26314	10	1	1	light grai on hot sunni dai the color of the hous wouldnt absorb so much heat so the hous wouldnt get so hot but if it wa a cold dai the color of the hous could reflect the cold air becaus e lighter color reflect heat amp darker color absorb heat .
26315	10	0	0	light grai becaus the dog might be jumpi and get mud paw print on the hous
26316	10	2	2	black the paint color will help to keep the dog warm becaus in the result of the experi the black lid heat up faster .
26317	10	1	1	white the best color would be white becaus as shown in the tabl white absorb less heat energi and therefor stai cooler so that mean the dog would stai cooler .
26318	10	2	2	white the color white might affect the doghous by make it cooler . i know thi becaus the temperatur for the air in the glass jar with the black lid wa warmer then the white lid .
26319	10	2	2	black in the experi the black lid on the jar held the most heat so if you color the doghous black the temperatur insid the doghous would stai at a higher constant temperatur . the black lid had the highest averag temperatur of 53 deg c dark grai had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c light grai had an averag of 45 deg c and white had the lowest temperatur with 42 deg c
26320	10	2	2	white white would reflect more heat and keep the dog from bake in the summer . the averag temperatur of the white lid jar wa 42 deg while the averag temperatur of the black lid jar wa 53 deg . the white wa 11 deg cooler so if the doghous wa white that should stop the dog from be fri in the summer .
26321	10	2	2	dark grai if brandi and jerri paint the doghous dark grai i think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool enough in the summer becaus dark grai ha the medium warm temperatur on the chart about the color lid .
26322	10	1	1	dark grai i chose dark grai caus it will be warm for the dog in the winter and cool in the summer .
26323	10	2	2	white in the experi the color white absorb less heat . so if you want your dog to stai cool you should pick white that wai he or she isnt as hot .
26324	10	0	0	dark grai easi to light make stai dark
26325	10	2	2	white the purpos of a doghous is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain . white is a good choic becaus it let the least amount of heat into the jar . the temperatur of the white jar wa an averag of 11 deg c less than the temperatur of black jar .
26326	10	1	1	white it will be cooler insid
26327	10	2	2	white thi color will cool down the doghous . the result show that on everi trial the white temperatur wa lower than all other color in the experi .
26328	10	1	1	light grai i think light grai paint would work best to paint the doghous becaus in the summer black would be wai to hot for the dog . the dog would feel most comfort ina light color hous in the summer so that it is a comfort temperatur . but in the winter white would be to cold and the dog would freez . the dog would want to be warm in the winter . in the experi the black heat to 53 deg c and the white heat to 42 deg c witch is a differ of 11 deg c . that is why the doghous should be light grai instead of black white or dark grai .
26329	10	2	2	white paint the doghous white would keep the temperatur cooler insid the doghous . the arm with the white lid had the coolest temperatur insid the jar . the darker the color of the lid got the warmer the insid of the jar wa .
26330	10	0	0	white i think white becaus had the less averag insid the glass . the reason i didnt pick the other color is becaus it is gonna be to dark so therefor you couldnt see anyth t night sot heir i would pick white becaus u can see them better
26331	10	1	1	black black might affect the doghous becaus it go to be dark hot and not comfort .
26332	10	2	2	white i chose white becaus the white paint color doesn t absorb that much energi than the other color and also the air temperatur insid wouldnt be as high as the other color . so if the white doghous wa place under the sun and the start temperatur would be 24 deg c the averag temperatur would onli rise up to 42 deg c . but if the color of the doghous wa black or grai than the temperatur would be in the 45 deg c 53 deg c . so white doghous would be a great pick for the color of the doghous .
26333	10	1	1	light grai i pick light grai becaus in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool . thi color mean that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter .
26334	10	2	2	black black will make the doghous to hot . the dog will not go in the doghous becaus the dog will not feel comfort . in the lab the black got wai more heat then the other color that were us .
26335	10	0	0	white white doesnt take in color from the rainbow like black and other color
26336	10	2	2	black black absorb heat therefor it would make the doghous warmer than all of the other color . thi can be support becaus in the experi black got up to 53 deg c and the white onli got up to 42 deg c . black wa the warmest
26337	10	1	1	light grai light grai would be best becaus it wouldnt be not to hot and not to cold .
26338	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai becaus it wouldnt be to hot and it wouldnt be to cold .
26339	10	1	1	black black will keep the dog warm but if you live ina hot area than white
26340	10	2	2	light grai the doghous color should be light grai becaus in the lid experi the hottest color wa black and the coolest color wa white . i chose light grai becaus you dont want the dog to be to c old in the doghous becaus in their experi the coldest lid wa the white lid and the averag temperatur for that lid wa 42 deg so i though is stead of have the doghous that cold why not have it light grai becaus the averag temperatur for the light grai lid turn out to be 45 deg
26341	10	2	2	white it should be white becaus in the experi the white lid had the lowest air temperatur . you dont want your dog tog e t to hot dure the summer .
26342	10	2	2	white the color white would be good for the doghous becaus it is the color that doe not attract heat so the insid of the doghous wont be hot . in the experi the color white wa the lowest te mixtur out of the other color so it would beth best color for the doghous .
26343	10	2	2	white i chose white becaus the white wa the coolest in all 4 trial . the white color repel the heat of the lamp keep it cool . on hot dai the dog would stai cool .
26344	10	1	0	white if thei pick white then the dog will be more cold than if thei pick black thi is becaus the darker color like black and grai take in more heat and energi and if thei pick white it take in less heat and energi so therefor brandi and jerri should pick a dark c color
26345	10	0	0	light grai if you paint the insid of the doghous light grai it would affect the temp . of the insid of the doghous . it would keep it warm insid if it wa cold outsid .
26346	10	1	1	black it might affect the doghous becaus it obes mr heat energi with a darker color .
26347	10	1	1	white white paint would make the doghous cooler becaus white paint reflect light .
26348	10	2	2	light grai i chose light grai becaus that wai the doghous could stai cool and the dog wouldnt be too hot . black wa an averag of 53 and light grai wa 45 . so it a just right roof .
26349	10	1	1	black black absorb more heat from the sun thi is good becaus in the winter the dog will be veri warm insid but dure the hot summer dai the dog probabl wont us it so black would beth best option
26350	10	1	0	white white can reflect more heat then black becaus black absorb more heat
26351	10	2	2	white white would beth best color for the dog hous becaus in the experi the data in the chart show that white kept the coolest temperatur of 41 deg c light grai had the second coolest t temperatur of 44 deg c dark grai had the second hottest temperatur of 48 deg c and black had the hottest temperatur of 54 deg c .
26352	10	0	0	white the color white would be a good color fora dog hous becaus from the data it sai that the averag temperatur wa 4 2 deg insid the jar that onli went up 18 deg
26353	10	1	1	light grai the color light grai will heat the doghous but it wont overheat it and it will not under heat it either .
26354	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous becaus it will make it warmer for the dog to like in .
26355	10	1	1	light grai i would chose light grai becaus on a cold dai ani heat you be absorb into the doghous and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter dai the grai wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot .
26356	10	2	2	black it will make the doghous warmer than ani of the other color becaus in the experi the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most like have the warmest effect on the doghous
26357	10	1	1	black dark grei keep a consist heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold season . thi will keep a dog more comfort .
26358	10	2	2	dark grai thei should us the dark grai becaus thei want the doghous warm for the winter and the night but not to warm becaus of summer if thei us the dark grai then the doghous stai warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer . thi color will affect the insid becaus it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark grai will keep the doghous warm and cozi for the dog but not to warm for the summer . the dark grai kept the jar at a temperatur of 48 deg the black kept it at 53 deg the light grai kept it at 45 deg and the white kept it at 42 deg . these result show that if thei us black the dog hose would get to hot . if thei us the white the doghous would be too cold . the dark grai would keep the hous at a warm temperatur for the dog .
26359	10	1	1	white the color white would effect the doghous by make it cooler insid .
26360	10	2	2	light grai that color would effect the doghous becaus when the sun wa up it would maintain 44 deg 46 deg c . that would keep the dog comfort while the sun wa out .
26361	10	2	2	white the color white might affect the doghous becaus sinc white is averi light color it doe not absorb light as well a dark color would . the dark color would not onli absorb the light but would also creat heat energi . from the result in the experi white wa the color that i had chosen becaus the air in the glass jar did not get near as hot as all the other . also pick the color that didnt creat as much heat as all the other is the best to choos becaus then the dog stai cool .
26362	10	1	1	white it would not affect the doghous to much becaus it absorb less heat then the other color and that allow the doghous to not get to hot .
26363	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai will make the doghous absorb a lot of energi but not as much as black becaus in the experi it averag at 48 deg c and black averag at 53 deg c .
26364	10	1	1	white white ha less energi absorb so it will cool down better than black would .
26365	10	1	2	white thei should paint the doghous white becaus it is alight color and attract less heat the black lid got the highest temperatur show thei should not us black pain becaus it attract heat
26366	10	2	2	white thi color will affect the doghous by make it cooler on the insid becaus in the air temperatur data brandi and jerri figur out that white color didnt attract much heat becaus compar to the black to white lid the black lid wa 11 deg c more hot than the white lid .
26367	10	2	2	white white would be a good color for the doghous becaus it doesnt absorb as much energi as the other color . thi mean that the temperatur insid the doghous wont be as hot . in the scenario the temperatur of the air for the white lid wa 42 deg c and the temperatur of the black dark grai and light grai lid were 53 deg c 48 deg c and 45 deg c . thi inform show that the white lid had a lower temperatur than the other three lid .
26368	10	2	2	white if the doghous wa white the insid would be cooler then the rest of the color . in the experi the white lid wa 11 degre cooler then the black .
26369	10	1	1	white i would paint it white that wai show from the tabl the temperatur wouldnt get so hot .
26370	10	2	2	light grai the color light grai would beth best paint for the doghous . dure the experi light grei had an averag of 48 deg c compar to black who averag wa 53 deg c and white who wa 42 deg c . light grei would affect the doghous becaus it is a color that soak up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghous .
26371	10	1	0	white so it doesnt get hot in the hous
26372	10	2	2	white the doghous will remain cooler in the summer . the white lid onli had an averag of 42 deg c in the jar while the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c in the jar .
26373	10	1	0	dark grai thi color would keep the doghous warmer dure the winter and hotter dure the summer . therefor thi would be ag old paint color for the doghous . i know thi becaus in the experi thei did the air temperatur in the dark grai color lid insid the jar wa around 45 deg while the darkest color lid wa hotter and the lightest wa cooler .
26374	10	1	1	white becaus the lighter the doghous is the cooler it is in the sun .
26375	10	2	2	white if brandi and jerri chose white as the color for their doghous then it ll affect the temperatur by it be much cooler insid rather than a black or dark grai color which would make it much warmer .
26376	10	1	1	white white will attract a less amount of heat tot he doghous . it is the best paint color becaus it will provid shelter for the dog from the sun and provid a cooler environ .
26377	10	1	1	white if thei us white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the insid of it cool becaus white reflect light .
26378	10	1	2	dark grai i choos dark grai becaus the color will not make the doghous too cold and not too hot . the result show that the highest temp futur wa 48 deg c and the lowest wa 48 deg c .
26379	10	1	1	light grai i would chose light grai becaus from all the color it isnt the least amount of air temperatur and it isnt the greatest . so i believ that it just right for the dog becaus it wont sun ficht or it wont have to much . the first trial for the light grei wa 4 4 deg c and the temperatur just went up by on which make it 45 deg c and the third trial it also went up by on 46 deg c . thi make the hous veri predict about what the temperatur is go to be .
26380	10	2	2	white a white doghous would make the insid of that doghous cooler in the summer but it wouldnt make it as warm in the winter sinc in the experi the white lid captur less light than ani other color of lid .
26381	10	1	1	dark grai thi color will make the temperatur in the dog hous will caus the doghous to stai cool but also collect heat . in the experi the dark grai got up to 48 deg c .
26382	10	2	2	black black will make the doghous warmer than the other color becaus it got an averag of 53 while the other color got in the 40 s .
26383	10	2	2	black black might affect the doghous becaus thi color will heat the doghous the most . black base on the experi wa abl to absorb the most light energi out of all the color lid . for exampl in trial 1 black had a temperatur of 52 degre c elia compar to dark grai which wa 48 degre calcium . light grai had 44 degre calcium and white had 42 degre calcium . evid black will keep the doghous most warm compar to the other three color .
26384	10	1	1	white white becaus the doghous wont get to hot for the dog and the temperatur will beat a low risk for the dog to get heatstrok .
26385	10	1	1	light grai light grai is a good choic becaus it keep the doghous cool on a hot dai but it will keep some heat on cooler dai .
26386	10	1	1	black thi color will make the doghous absorb more light . becaus it is black heat will absorb on thi faster then dark grai light grai or white .
26387	10	2	2	white if thei us white the doghous will be cooler than if thei us black becaus the averag temperatur insid the jar wa 42 deg c fora white lid and 53 deg c fora black lid .
26388	10	1	1	light grai i chose light grei becaus it will still attract heat and absorb some but not a ton . thi wai the doghous will beat the right temperatur and out of the sun . choos alight color for thi will be good for spring summer fall or those winter dai when the sun come out . it will be a dry place at the perfect temperatur if you paint it light grei .
26389	10	1	1	white the white doghous can help the dog cool off and it keep it cooler in the doghous unlik black and the darker color that absorb the heat and then so warm the doghous and therebi increas the term deg
26390	10	1	1	white white becaus that color doesnt absorb everi and the doghous be cooler
26391	10	1	1	white it will make it cooler in there so it not burn hot in the summer
26392	10	1	1	black if it black the doghous might conduct more heat but if you choos a lighter color it will not attract as much heat as the dark color .
26393	10	2	2	white brandi and jerri should us white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun . white would be best becaus it will absorb the least energi keep the temp down in the test a black color lid wa and averag temp of 53 while the white color wa 42 and 11 deg differ .
26394	10	2	2	light grai light grai would make it so the dog wa cool insid the hous and not to hot and to cold . at black the temperatur wa 53 deg c and at white the temperatur wa 42 deg c . but at light grai it wa 45 deg c so then the temperatur would not be to hot or to cold .
26395	10	1	1	white brandi and jerri should us the color white for the doghous becaus brighter color reflect light to keep the door cool . unless it is the wintertim and you want to keep the dog warm adar her color would be better .
26396	10	2	2	white i chose white for the color of paint for the doghous . white might affect the doghous by keep the insid cooler dure the dai . when the glass jar had a black lid the averag temperatur wa 53 deg c . when the glass jar had a white lid after ten minut the averag temperatur in the jar wa onli 42 deg c . thi is a differ of 11 deg c . white is the better choic for paint color on a doghous becaus it will keep a dog cool in the middl of the dai .
26397	10	1	0	white the experi show that if the color is white the less hot the object get . so if brandi and jerri paint it white the dog would not be as hot if it wa black .
26398	10	0	0	light grai thi color should make the doghous a nice cool temperatur constantli . i sai thi becaus in the data tabl light grai s averag temp . wa 45 deg .
26399	10	2	2	black i think thi color will effect the doghous by heat it up when there light energi or heat energi insid of it becaus black got the highest averag of 53 c deg
26400	10	0	0	white it not to dark
26401	10	2	2	white white would affect the color by not let the doghous heat up becaus with the data the result wa the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the doghous nice and fresh .
26402	10	2	2	dark grai i chose the color dark grai becaus when it is cold outsid the hous will absorb heat and warm up the doghous so it wont be cold . but when it is realli hot outsid it wont absorb as much energi as the black paint so it will be a littl cool .
26403	10	2	2	white white made the jar the coolest on averag in the experi at 42 deg c . while black on averag made the jar the hottest at 53 deg c . so if you paint the doghous white the temperatur insid the doghous should be cooler than if you paint it black dark grai or light grai .
26404	10	2	2	white if your design for your doghous wa to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choos the white becaus after ten minut of a lamp heat the white color kept the temperatur down to 42 deg c while the black lid kept the temperatur to 53 deg c
26405	10	1	1	white if the color of the doghous wa white then i think the dog that live there will want togo in the doghous more often becaus it not go to be realli hot it go to be cool .
26406	10	2	2	light grai light grai . becaus the color is not that dark but not that light ether . for the summer it wont be that hot and in the winter it wont be that cold ether . also the temperatur of the data came out that the grai color is right in the middl averag of the experi .
26407	10	1	2	white thi wai the doghous will stai cool sinc the jar with the white lid had the averag temperatur or 42 deg c .
26408	10	0	0	dark grai the greater the increas in the air temperatur in the glass jar becaus darker color absorb more energi .
26409	10	2	2	black it would make it warmer for the dog so it would be warmer insid the doghous so the dog would not be too cold . in the experi the result show that the darker the color the warmer it is insid .
26410	10	2	1	light grai light grai would be a good color to paint the doghous . on reason i chose thi is becaus when the sun is beat down on the doghous the dog could overheat . also the opposit is true as well . if you had a white doghous it mai make the dog veri cold . the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c and the white lid had an averag of 42 deg c . thi make a grei paint doghous the best choic .
26411	10	1	1	black i think that black she point the doghous becaus it dark and it could absorb more energi and increas in air temper re .
26412	10	1	1	white the test prove white doesnt get as hot as other color
26413	10	2	2	white the best color to choos for brandi and jerri es doghous would be white becaus white doesnt absorb as much heat as doe darker color for exampl in the air temperatur experi . thei put a dark color lid over ajar with a start temperatur point at 24 c elia . after ten minut the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and wa record at an averag of 53 c . but when thei put the lighter cover lid over the jar at a start point of c after 10 minut thei saw that the jar wa an averag of onli 42 c . so the best choic would beth color white for your doghous becaus it will not absorb as much heat and will stai cooler for your dog .
26414	10	2	2	dark grai the dark grai color fora doghous might be best to keep the dog warm in the winter with the littl sun it receiv but not overli heat in the summer . in the experi the dark grai had the second to highest air temperatur with 48 deg . a black hous might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthi for the dog . in the investig the air temperatur of black wa at 53 deg . the light grai and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthi for the dog . the air temperatur of the light grai wa 45 deg and of the white wa 42 deg . thi is why i would choos the dark grai paint fora doghous .
26415	10	1	1	white as shown in brandi and jerri s experi white absorb less light than the other color . if the doghous is paint white than the air temperatur will be less insid of the doghous sot he dog will be cooler insid of the doghous .
26416	10	2	2	white in the test of which color made the air insid of the jar hottest the black wa the hottest then came the dark grai than light grei then the white wa the coolest so the air insid of the doghous would be cooler if it wa white which would be best for the dog .
26417	10	1	1	white it will make it cooler insid becaus the white color will deflect light from the hous
26418	10	0	0	white dark color attract heat lighter color repel heat
26419	10	0	0	black be goe onc you go black u never go back
26420	10	1	1	white thei should choos white becaus thei dont want their dog to get realli hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stai cool on the insid .
26421	10	1	1	light grai light grei would work good becaus it almost in the middl and maintain a good temperatur so it doesnt get to hot but not to cold
26422	10	2	2	white white is the best color to us for the doghous . thi is becaus the color white reflect the most sunlight and therefor it wont be as hot insid the hous . with the white color jar lid the averag temperatur is 42 deg c . the averag for the light grai dark grai and black lid were 45 deg c 48 deg c and 53 deg c . thi show that have the doghous be white would keep the air cooler and more comfort for the dog .
26423	10	2	1	white it is the brightest color in thi select and the darker the color the more energi it will absorb . the doghous will usual be humid and hot and dry insid for the dog if a lot of the sun solar energi is be absorb and spread throughout the doghous . evid of thi is in the investig by look at the averag column of the data tabl . by do so you can see that white had the lowest averag temperatur at 42 deg c while the black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . dark and light grai were also abov white averag make white the best suit color for the doghous .
26424	10	1	1	light grai it will make it cool on warm and sunni dai but on winter dai it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and cold depend on the dai
26425	10	0	0	white in the summer the doghous would not be to warm and not as hot as warm as a doghous that is black .
26426	10	2	1	black us the result from the experi thebe t color for the doghous if you were look for the doghous to be warm would be black becaus in the experi it show that black heat up the most in the same amount of time .
26427	10	0	0	black i think black would beth best color becaus when it wa in the glass bottl after 10 minut it had the highest score .
26428	10	1	1	dark grai brandi and jerri should paint the doghous dark grai becaus then insid of the doghous it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog . if thei paint the hous black it would be too hot . the averag temperatur wa 53 deg c and the dark grai averag temperatur wa 48 deg c . light grai and white would make the insid of the doghous too cold becaus those temperatur averag at 45 deg c and 4 2 deg c . therefor dark grei is just right .
26429	10	1	1	white i chose white becaus the dog could go in the doghous and not get to hot from the heat of the sun becaus white doe not catch heat as easili as black .
26430	10	2	2	white in the experi thei said darker color as rb more heat and you do not want more heat in you re dog hous . and you dont want you re dog to overheat so i pick white so it stai cool dure the summer .
26431	10	1	1	white i sai that thei should us white becaus from the data thei had from the experi it show that darker color absorb more energi then ani other color . white would not take as much absorb energi as shown in the data tabl given becaus it alight color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energi in it hous .
26432	10	1	1	light grai if you were to paint the doghous light grai the temperatur insid the doghous would not be as hot in summertim or not as cold in the wintertim as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark grai would be hotter just not as much . light grai would be justin the middl of all of them .
26433	10	2	1	white i think white might beth best color for the doghous becaus when it sunni out the temperatur insid the dog hous will be cooler becaus in the experi we learn that white is cooler prove that it absorb less heat .
26434	10	1	1	white is becaus on a hot dai it wont be as hot in the doghous if you us white if you us black the dog would be to hot .
26435	10	1	1	black it will beth hottest becaus darker color absorb more energi .
26436	10	1	1	dark grai thi color would make the doghous warm but not too warm and it wont be cold insid either .
26437	10	2	1	light grai i chose the light grai paint becaus in the summertim the doghous wont be too hot or too cold . the light grai rose 21 deg c in ten minut wherea the black rose 29 deg c and that mean that when it hot outsid the temperatur in the doghous will be hot and uncomfort .
26438	10	1	1	white the insid of the doghous would be cooler with the color white and with black it would be hotter
26439	10	0	0	black black becaus it effect lid color on the air temperatur and becaus it absorb more energi .
26440	10	1	1	white have a white color for the doghous will effect keep the dog at a temperatur where the sun wouldnt gradual increas the temperatur too hot for the dog to live insid doghous . accord to a experi on lid color vs . air temperatur insid glass jar a white lid did not help increas the temperatur insid the jar . while a grei and black lid effect increas the temperatur over 6 degre .
26441	10	0	0	dark grai i choos dark grai as the color for the doghous becaus the white color would be good for summer but then dure the winter the dog would get too cold . the black color would be good for winter but then dure summer the dog would get too hot . the light grai color would be good for summer spring and winter but not for fall . the dark grai would be good for summer fall and winter and the dog would probabl spend most of hi her time outsid dure spring . i would paint the doghous dark grai .
26442	10	2	2	light grai light grai would beth best color fora dog hous becaus if the dog is outsid and it cold outsid the light grai still tract some warmth to it but not too much for when it hot outsid . in the experi light grai had the averag of 45 deg c while white had 42 deg c and the black had an averag of 53 deg c . thi show that white would be too cold becaus it would not attract a lot of sunlight . the black is too hot by attract too much sunlight but the light grai attract enough sunlight to keep the hous cool and warm .
26443	10	1	1	light grai thi color might affect the doghous by make the doghous not too hot and not too cold for the dog a comfort temperatur for the dog .
26444	10	0	0	black trial 1 54 trial 2 52 trial 3 54 trial 4 53 . thi color would keep keep it warm when it need to be warm and keep it cool when it need to be cool .
26445	10	0	0	white that color might affect the doghous becaus the temp true will be good for the doghous .
26446	10	1	1	light grai i choos light grai becaus in the winter grai is kinda dark it will be warm and in the summer it will be cool caus of the light grai .
26447	10	1	1	black the color black absorb more light so the doghous will be warmer .
26448	10	1	1	dark grai the darker the color is the hotter the insid of the hous will get so i pick dark grei becaus black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold .
26449	10	1	1	black black would affect the air temperatur in the doghous . in the experi the black lid color had on averag of 53 deg c . thi color would greatli effect the doghous in the summer . on hot dai the black color would attract heat which would be a health issu for the dog .
26450	10	0	0	light grai light grai would be a good color becaus if you us black then that would attract energi from the sun caus the sun to littl doghous and the dog will get to hot . so if we us light it will slightli attract some energi from the sun becaus the color is a mixtur between black and white make the dog the right temperatur .
26451	10	1	1	light grai it will help the doghous becaus in the summer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will keep it warm a littl
26452	10	2	2	black thi color will make the insid of the doghous warmer than the other color . dark grai averag temperatur wa 48 degre calcium light grai averag temperatur wa 45 degre calcium and white averag temperatur wa 42 degre calcium .
26453	10	1	0	light grai if you us alight grai paint then the insid of the doghous wont be super hot for the dog
26454	10	0	0	white it might affect it by the deg c level in the doghous and it will make it not as cold as the other color so it ah otter temperatur .
26455	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai could help the dog stai cool in the summer but also stai warm in the winter . in the result of the lab the dark grai had 48 degre all the wai through the experi . the dark grai color would beth best color for the doghous .
26456	10	1	2	black how the color might affect the doghous is by the temperatur of the insid of the doghous . with the proven fact by the experi that darker color absorb more heat paint the doghous the color black will increas the temperatur of insid the doghous . in the experi brandi and jerri got the result that the color blackout of all the color had the hottest temperatur of the insid of the glass jar .
26457	10	1	1	dark grai it make the hous pretti hot so the dog wont get cold but it not so hot that the dog will get too warm
26458	10	0	0	light grai becaus it isnt too dark and it isnt too light it just right for the dog eyesight .
26459	10	1	0	dark grai that effect would warm up the doghous sooth dog will not be cold .
26460	10	2	2	black if thei us the color black the insid air te matur would beth warmest accord to there data .
26461	10	1	1	dark grai i think that a dark grai would beth best color to paint the doghous . sens dark color attract solar heat . . . but it all depend on where the doghous will be locat . . . for exampl . . . if your somewher where it normal hot outsid . . . you should paint the hous white or light grai . but if thi doghous is go to be somewher where it normal cold outsid . . . paint it dark grai or black .
26462	10	0	0	black it my favorit color
26463	10	1	1	light grai i think it would be light grai becaus dog dont like to be that warn and not that cold .
26464	10	2	2	white if you paint the doghous white it will stai nice and cool and wont get too hot becaus the data show that when the lid wa white the averag temperatur 42 deg c wa colder than the other . when the lid wa black the averag temperatur wa highest 53 deg c which is 11 deg more than the white lid averag .
26465	10	0	0	white ti make ti littl
26466	10	1	1	white i think thei should paint the doghous white becaus in the summer it will keep the doghous cooler insid and keep the dog from get to hot .
26467	10	1	1	light grai light grai might not affect the doghous becaus in the summer when it realli hot it went wont get realli hot insid becaus light grai is not as dark . the doghous might just beth right temperatur not to hot and not to cold just right .
26468	10	1	1	white it will affect the doghous becaus i wont be as hot insid if it paint white but if it paint black or anoth color it will be hotter insid .
26469	10	1	1	white white would affect the doghous by make it cooler than ani other color shown .
26470	10	1	1	white white will make the doghous as cool as possibl
26471	10	2	2	white have a white color doghous is the best option becaus it the on that got the lowest temperatur in the experi which wa 42 deg c averag . and sinc you dont want your dog to get a heatstrok then white the best . the other color averag were black 53 deg c dark grai 48 deg c and light grai 45 deg c which ar to hot fora dog to be live in .
26472	10	0	0	white thi is the best possibl paint color fora doghous for the summer . but for the winter it would be black .
26473	10	2	2	white white is the best color to paint the dog hous becaus in brandi and jerri s experi the darker lid had a higher temperatur . black had a end temperatur averag of 53 deg c and the white lid had a end temperatur averag of 42 deg c . therefor white would beth better paint color to keep the doghous cooler for the dog .
26474	10	1	1	white the white paint would make it colder in the doghous on hot summer dai .
26475	10	0	1	white less color energi less hot the dog hous will be
26476	10	0	0	black becaus it averag is veri high . and it could do someth to it .
26477	10	1	1	black darker color attract and absorb more light o if you paint the doghous black then the sun rai will hit the hous and caus the black paint to absorb the light and keep the doghous warmer .
26478	10	1	1	light grai it will heat the doghous so it is warm and not to hot or too cold becaus in the data the light grai color wa just about the middl .
26479	10	2	2	white the white lid had the lowest temperatur at 42 degre calcium so it would make the doghous allot cooler compar to the black lid at 53 degre calcium
26480	10	2	1	black i chose black becaus the averag insid temperatur after ten minut wa 53 degre calcium so then the doghous would be warmer for the dog .
26481	10	2	2	black if thei us black for there doghous there dog would be veri warm becaus it would keep all the heat in there for keep the dog warm becaus the black will be trade in the heat that is why peopl dont wear black on a hot dai . i can sai thi becaus in the data tabl for black the averag temperatur wa 53 deg and that wa the highest temperatur there wa thi is why i think brandi and jerri should us black for there doghous .
26482	10	2	2	white it would make it cooler than the other color . white end up about 42 deg c while black wa about 53 deg c .
26483	10	0	0	white white will affect the doghous becaus it averag of air temperatur insid a glass jar for 10 minut wa 42 deg while light grai wa 45 deg dark grai wa 48 deg and black wa 53 deg .
26484	10	0	0	black becaus dog ar color blind and if the doghous is paint black then the dog wouldnt be abl to see it .
26485	10	2	2	white white will reduc the temperatur insid the doghous . in the experi white had an averag of 42 deg c while the other color had higher temperatur averag .
26486	10	2	2	black the black paint would absorb heat . that would keep the doghous warm . the result show that the jar with the black lid wa th warmest after 10 minut .
26487	10	1	0	dark grai i how not mack the doghous black it will be to hot
26488	10	2	1	white it will make the air cooler becaus it averag wa 42 . it start at 24 so it onli went up by 18 and black went up by 29 becaus black end at 53 .
26489	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai would be better becaus you dont want the dog to be cold if it were to live in the doghous but you dont want it to be to warm for the dog .
26490	10	2	2	white white is averi light color . but with black it attract the sun . so insid thi doghous when black it can get hot . but with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53 deg c as the black had . the white had a averag of 42 deg c which is not hot compar to 53 deg c .
26491	10	1	1	black the color affect the doghous by the tempt ar insid the doghous if the color is darker it will be hotter if the color is lighter it will he colder and soon . and becaus the doghous will probabl be outsid i chose black so that it is warmer
26492	10	1	1	light grai it wont be as hot insid of the doghous make it more comfort for the dog in the hotter month but it will still be warm enough that the dog will be comfort in the colder month .
26493	10	1	1	light grai the color might affect the doghous becaus light grai will not make it too hot or too cold the temperatur will be in the middl .
26494	10	2	2	black thi color will help keep the insid of the doghous warmer . the black color lid is 9 deg warmer than the white color lid .
26495	10	2	2	light grai after be expos to heat white wa the coolest with 42 deg c follow by light grai with 45 deg c dark grai and then black . by us light grei the doghous would stai fairli cool in the summer unlik black and absorb a fair amount of heat in the cold winter unlik white .
26496	10	2	2	black well the darker the color is the more heat it produc in the atmospher so id suggest black becaus the dog is outsid so the dog will stai warm at a good temperatur . on the tabl of the experi it show that have a black lid on trial on gave it 54 degre on white on trial on it wa onli about 42 degre . 12 degre differ
26497	10	1	1	white it will not make it hot dure the summer so the dog can cool himself
26498	10	2	2	white i would choos white becaus it will keep the dog cool in the summertim becaus the white lid had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c wherea the light grei had an averag of 45 deg c the dark grei had an averag of 48 deg c and the black had an averag of 53 deg c .
26499	10	2	1	black if thei us black paint on the doghous then the doghous will be hotter than with ani other color . in the experi the black lid averag temperatur wa 53 degre and all the other color were more cold .
26500	10	2	2	white the color white would affect the doghous by cool it off becaus in the experi the air temperatur of the jar with the white lid wa 42 degre in comparison to the air temperatur in the jar with the black lid which wa 53 degre . that make black 9 degre hotter then white .
26501	10	0	0	white whit wouldnt realli affect it caus in the winter there is not much sun so the color would make no differ but in the summer it would beth same becaus sun doe not affect the color white especi in the heat .
26502	10	1	1	black becaus when it get hot outsid the sun attract black and then it will heat up the doghous and the doghous would get to hot and then the dog would realli hot .
26503	10	0	1	white white would probabl beth best choic to paint the doghous . it would stai at a temperatur of about 42 deg c . thi color doesnt attract heat like black or dark color do . so i think thi would beth best choic .
26504	10	0	0	light grai i have know idea
26505	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous cooler than ani darker color . thi is becaus the averag air temperatur of the jar with the white lid wa 42 deg c the light grei lid wa 45 deg c the dark grei lid wa 48 deg c and the black lid wa 53 deg c . the differ between the darkest black lid and the white lid wa 11 deg c .
26506	10	2	2	white white so the doghous stai cooler becaus ac word to the tabl white make the temp insid the jar the coolest
26507	10	1	1	black black would affect the doghous becaus the sun attract to black veri easili and will make the doghous veri hot on the insid .
26508	10	1	1	white it will make it cooler for the dog and the dog wont overheat and becom thirsti all the time
26509	10	1	1	white the white paint color would keep the insid of the doghous more cooler than the other color becaus lighter color absorb less heat .
26510	10	1	1	black thei should do the doghous black becaus the averag in the experi wa 53 deg and that is around the tempest ar that a dog would wanna stai in while it sleep also becaus when it sunni the black darken the doghous while the dog sleep .
26511	10	1	1	dark grai i pick the color becaus if it is hot dai the dog wouldnt want hi hous black becaus it will just make it too hot for him then if it white it will just be too cool for him . so i that dark grai will be just warm enough for him
26512	10	2	2	light grai the best color for brandi and jerri to paint their doghous would probabl light grai . thi is becaus while the lid that absorb the most heat black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c and the coolest white had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c the light grei lid had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c a medium between the two which would make the doghous retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer .
26513	10	1	1	dark grai can keep warm temperatur for the dog in the winter but not so hot in the summer
26514	10	0	0	white it will be better becaus the whiter the color the better becaus it will not absorb that much energi .
26515	10	1	1	white thi color would affect the doghous becaus the color white reflect light while as the color black or darker color absorb light so with the choic of white the doghous would not heat up as much as it would if brandi and jerri were to us a darker color .
26516	10	2	2	black thi color will keep the insid of the doghous warmer . dark color absorb more heat energi . in the experi with the jar the air wa alwai warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jar with lighter color
26517	10	0	0	black thi color might affect the doghous becaus black absorb the most energi that is given . it is shown in the result that black lid color ha an averag of 53 deg c
26518	10	1	1	light grai i chose light grai becaus it would stai cool in summer and a littl warmer in the winter .
26519	10	2	2	black us black as the color of the doghous will make it hotter . in the experi the black lid made the air the hottest . thi would help the dog stai warmer in the winter . it would beth best color choic as long as the owner live ina cold climat .
26520	10	2	2	light grai the light color of the doghous will help to keep the doghous cool and ideal in hot temperatur but will also absorb enough thermal energi from the sun to had a semi warm environ . while the black lid color in the experi creat an averag jar air temperatur of 53 deg that temperatur is veri hot and a deg would feel veri uncomfort within that environ . howev if we look at the white lid it had an averag temperatur of 42 deg . that temperatur is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal everi on dai that it is cooler . howev the light grai lid had an averag of 45 deg in the trial . it temperatur wa most ideal and it would creat the most balanc environ for the dog to live in .
26521	10	2	1	black black would make the doghous warm insid . in the experi the averag temperatur for black jar wa 53 deg c
26522	10	1	1	white the color white would affect the doghous becaus the temperatur will be cooler .
26523	10	1	1	light grai it would keep the doghous at a good temperatur not attract to much light but enough to where the doghous isnt veri cold .
26524	10	1	0	light grai it will put some heat in but will also keep it cool in the dai
26525	10	2	2	white white becaus white absorb less heat energi from the sun . in the experi brandi and jerri discov that darker color affect how much energi thei can absorb . so that s why white is the best color to choos to make anew doghous . becaus it doesnt absorb that much energi from the sun .
26526	10	2	2	black black darker color paint will absorb the energi from the light sourc lamp and keep it heat up insid the doghous . like the air temperatur experi the black lid color had 54 deg c while the white lid color had a 42 deg c prove that the darker the color there is the more heat is absorb keep it more warm .
26527	10	1	1	dark grai dark grei would beth best color for them to make the doghous becaus the air temperatur wouldnt be too hot or too cold for the dog . also the temperatur stai the same for all the trial which mean that it wont chang no matter how hot the weather mayb .
26528	10	2	2	dark grai i would choos to paint the doghous dark grai becaus the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldnt make the doghous too warm or cold . the data support thi becaus the jar with the dark grai lid had a temperatur that wa more in between that of the black and white jar when the light grai jar had a temperatur that wa closer to the white jar make it to cold .
26529	10	2	2	white it would affect the doghous by it would stai cool in there . in the experi white had the lowest temp futur
26530	10	0	0	dark grai not a lot just a agent the sun
26531	10	1	1	white it will make it warm insid the doghous becaus the light did not penetr it a lot so the thermomet did not go as high
26532	10	1	1	dark grai it will keep it a nice temperatur not too warm and not too cold
26533	10	0	0	white it wont be as hot for the dog .
26534	10	0	0	white i think white becaus it would keep the most heat out
26535	10	1	1	black the color black would effect the doghous becaus the sun is attract to the color black . also in the data tabl the color black ha the highest result on the temperatur .
26536	10	2	2	dark grai thi color will allow the doghous to be reli live warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c often rb le . the averag temperatur of the dark grai lid wa 48 deg c 5 deg c cooler than the averag temperatur for the hottest lid which wa the black lid and therefor show that the doghous will be abl to sustain a coat tabl temperatur .
26537	10	2	2	white the doghous should be white becaus the color white deflect the heat wave so the insid of the doghous would be cooler . if the doghous wa paint black it would absorb more heat wave and then the doghous would get hotter .
26538	10	1	1	light grai it will make the doghous warmer in the winter but will not make it too warm in the summer .
26539	10	1	1	white paint the doghous white if where you live is hot becaus black attract too much heat . paint the doghous black if you live somewher cold becaus the heat cant affect that .
26540	10	2	1	white white might make the doghous cooler becaus white in the experi show it would increas the temperatur by 20 or so degre c . when black increas by 30 or so degre c .
26541	10	1	1	white i pick the white color becaus the affect of white color paint make the temperatur for the doghous to be a lot more cooler so if the doghous is white the dog temperatur will be a lot more cooler than the other color their is
26542	10	0	0	black the color might affect the doghous becaus mayb the dog sent like the color thei put on the dog hous or mere is to dark or to brief for the dog . and calcul and record the averag air temperatur for each lid color .
26543	10	2	1	black i chose black becaus black is go to keep the doghous warmer . if thei paint the doghous white the light will just reflect off butt if thei choos black then thei will keep the warm i know thi becaus on the experi thei did with the lamp the averag temperatur with the black lid wa 53 deg c but the averag temperatur with the white lid wa 42 deg c . so black would beth best color for the doghous .
26544	10	2	1	black thi would make the doghous veri hot and uncomfort becaus as shown in the experi black attract heat bring more thermal energi to the doghous than other color such as white .
26545	10	2	2	white the color white might affect the doghous by keep it cooler becaus the black had an averag of 53 deg c . the dark grai had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c and the light grai had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c . final the white had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c . so the black jar had the highest temperatur darkest color and the white had the lowest temperatur brightest color . so insid the doghous will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26546	10	0	0	black the color black might affect the doghous becaus black is the darkest color out of the s four color .
26547	10	1	1	white it should be white becaus if it a dark color it would attract more energi heat .
26548	10	1	1	black the black is go to make it a lot warmer insid the doghous
26549	10	1	1	white white becaus it will not tack or extra the heat .
26550	10	1	1	black it might affect the doghous becaus it a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghous sinc dark color absorb more energi .
26551	10	2	2	black thi color paint black will attract more heat to the insid of the doghous . we know thi becaus the averag of heat insid the jar on brandi and jerri experi wa 54 deg c for black paint and 42 deg c for the white paint . so you can see that if you were want to keep the insid of the doghous warm you would want to paint it black .
26552	10	1	1	black the color black might affect the insid of the doghous becaus if the color of the hous is darker it will increas the temp of the hous insid
26553	10	1	1	black it will make the temperatur insid of the doghous hotter .
26554	10	2	2	white paint the doghous white will make it sot hat the temperatur insid will be cooler becaus as test show white c compar to black can have a temperatur differ of 12 degre celsiu .
26555	10	1	1	white the white color mai affect the doghous by make it more cooler than solid color becaus it reflect the light instead of absorb more light energi caus form the sun .
26556	10	2	2	white white reflect the light . when you us white c color temperatur will lower than when you us dark color . in the expir he when you us white the temperatur wa deg c but when you us black the temperatur wa 53 deg c . when you us white color temperatur wa 9 deg c lower than when you us dark color .
26557	10	2	1	light grai in the test result the white at the averag of 42 deg c wa the coolest while black at the averag of 53 deg c wa the hottest . while light grai is averag 45 deg c it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog .
26558	10	2	2	dark grai dure each trial it stai 48 deg c which isnt to hot or cold . it might affect it bui whether it snow or realli cold outsid he wont freez becaus the color is try to attract some kind of heat . for when it hot it would attract some sunlight though but not as much as black . so it fairli comfort fora dog .
26559	10	1	1	black black would beth best color to us so that the dog will stai warm . the averag temperatur us black wa 53 . 25 deg c
26560	10	1	1	black paint the doghous black will result in the temperatur insid to be higher . the darker the color is on the outsid will absorb more heat energi into the doghous . thi will help becaus it will keep the dog warmer .
26561	10	1	1	black it would affect the doghous becaus the color black is go to make the doghous hotter .
26562	10	2	2	light grai thi color might affect the insid of the doghous becaus the result in the experi wa that the lighter the color the lower temperatur . i chose light grai becaus on sunni dai when the dog need shade or cool off it can just go into the doghous where it will beth perfect temperatur cold but not freez .
26563	10	0	0	black the color that i chose that mai effect the insid of the doghous becaus from heat it will give the dog shade forth e doghous . from the experi it show when thei put the dark black lid on top of the war it how that the temperatur decreas after thei put the thermomet in the glass war .
26564	10	0	0	black will absurd more energi
26565	10	2	2	white it would beth best becaus it would keep the dog cool becaus what had the lowest averag temperatur
26566	10	1	1	white the white absorb less heat and keep cooler
26567	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous cooler becaus it will be onli 42 deg c insid then if brandi and jerri were to us black it would be 54 deg c insid of the doghous becaus black absorb light and white reflect the light so the heat doesnt go insid of the doghous .
26568	10	2	2	light grai light grai becaus it wouldnt be that hot in the summertim and in would not be that cold . becaus in the result the averag for light grei wa 45 deg . and that in perfect temperatur
26569	10	1	1	light grai i chose the light grai becaus on averag it wa 45 deg c so it wouldnt be too hot o too cold for the dog .
26570	10	1	1	white the lighter the color is the more light energi it reflect . if most of the light energi is reflect the less hotter it will be insid the doghous or whatev you repaint .
26571	10	0	0	white the color of the doghous affect the temperatur insid .
26572	10	2	1	white i would chose white becaus that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be realli hot id want it to be as cold as i could get it . for black the averag wa the warmest with 53 deg c for dark grai it wa in the middl with 48 deg c for light grai it wa also in the middl with 45 deg c and white wa the coldest with 42 deg c . the white paint will keep the doghous less insul and more open . it will keep it so it not so hot and not so cold becaus 42 deg c isnt cold or hot it in the middl .
26573	10	1	2	white white would beth best color . thi is becaus on averag it had the lowest temperatur insid so it absorb or block the most heat it had an averag of 42 degre while black had an averag of 53 degre
26574	10	1	1	black it would increas the temperatur more than ani color select .
26575	10	0	0	black black
26576	10	2	2	white i think thei should go with white so the doghous doesnt get to hot becaus the black paint number wa 53 for the averag and the latest color white averag wa 42 so i think that the color that would be best for the doghous would be white becaus it reflect less heat from the other three color which were black dark ar light grei and white .
26577	10	1	1	white it would keep the insid of the doghous cooler
26578	10	0	1	white becaus white is the the color that reject all light there for keep the light rai from soak in caus heat
26579	10	2	1	light grai the lighter the color of the doghous the cooler the temperatur is insid and the darker the color of the doghous the warmer it is insid becaus when the lid color wa black the averag temperatur wa 53 deg c . but when the lid color wa white the averag temperatur wa 42 deg c which had a differ of 11 deg .
26580	10	0	0	black becaus black is a dark color and it will at act te sun so then the temperatur is go to chang
26581	10	1	1	light grai thei dont want it to be too cold but not too hot either . alight grai doghous wont be too cold for the dog but also not too hot becaus it ll just warm the doghous up 11 deg c . that isnt too much so the dog wont suffoc but it wont freez to death either .
26582	10	0	1	white assum that you want to keep the doghous c fool i would choos to paint it white becaus it reflect the least amount of light .
26583	10	2	2	black the averag temperatur insid the glass jar with a black lid wa 53 deg c . with a dark grai lid the averag temperatur wa 48 deg c . with alight grai lid the averag temperatur wa 45 deg c . with a white lid the averag temperatur wa 42 deg c . the start temperatur wa 24 deg c so the averag temperatur for the black lid rais the start temperatur by 29 deg c . the averag temperatur for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11 deg warmer than the white lid . therefor to keep the insid of the doghous warm and also to keep the dog warm in cold temperatur black would beth best color becaus it had the highest averag temperatur insid the glass jar .
26584	10	1	1	light grai i believ that the light grai color would be optim for the doghous . it would keep the temperatur insid to a pleasant level not too hot or cold . the averag temperatur of the jar with the light grai lid after ten minut wa 45 deg c .
26585	10	2	2	light grai light grai will affect the doghous becaus base on the data the light grai color wa the second coolest at an averag of 45 deg . thi will help becaus dure the summer when it is hot it will keep the doghous cooler . but it will also help dure the winter and keep the doghous warmer .
26586	10	1	1	light grai thi color would beth best for the doghous becaus if you were to us black the dog would get realli hot becaus the darker the color the more energi it will attract and make it hotter . if you us white then it doesnt get as much energi so the dog mai get cold becaus the lighter the color the less energi you will attract . light grai is in between so it will attract some energi but not to much .
26587	10	2	2	white the color white mai affect the doghous ina better wai than the other three color becaus accord to the data tabl the lid color black dark grai light grai all had higher air temperatur . the color white had the lowest averag air temperatur insid the jar . therefor white would be abett color for the doghous becaus the air temperatur insid of the doghous would be less than the other three color .
26588	10	1	1	black the color will increas the air temperatur insid the doghous .
26589	10	1	1	white thi would affect the doghous becaus in the summer the dog would stai cool and not get hot but in the winter it couldnt get colder than if the doghous wa black
26590	10	1	1	white the insid would be cooler becaus dark color absorb heat and white defect it
26591	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous more chill than black or dark grai caus of their hot temp . . when white ha a temp of 42 degre calcium . . keep the doghous nice and cold . .
26592	10	1	1	white i think the color for the doghous should beth color white becaus it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choos the black color insid the doghous it would be hot . the black color averag is 53 and the white color averag is 42 .
26593	10	0	0	black becaus the doghous would look filthi
26594	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous and make it hotter becaus black attract the sun
26595	10	0	0	dark grai dark grei becaus their all in all differ procedur
26596	10	1	2	dark grai the best paint color for the doghous would be dark grai becaus it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog insid . dark grai wa the color that absorb the second highest temperatur so the temperatur will keep the dog warm but not too hot .
26597	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it didnt heat up that much but it did a littl so the dog hous wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
26598	10	0	1	white the color should be white becaus so it not super super hot when the sun out .
26599	10	1	2	white us white to paint the doghous will affect it temperatur becaus it absorb the least amount of heat from the sun refer back to the hot lamp experi we know that white absorb the least amount of heat becaus in all 3 trial the averag amount of heat absorb by the white lid wa 42 deg after 10 minutest hat is onli 18 deg c more than the temperatur it start at 24 deg c . thi is how we would know which paint to us for the doghous .
26600	10	2	2	black the color black will make a higher temperatur in the doghous then dark grai light grai or white becaus darker color absorb more energi . thi is support by the data of the experi hot lamp . the averag temperatur insid the glass jar after 10 minut for the black lid wa 53 degre celsiu the averag temperatur for the dark grai lid insid the glass jar wa 48 degre celsiu thea averag temperatur for the light grai lid insid the glass jar after 10 minut wa 45 degre celsiu and the averag temperatur insid the glass jar after 10 minut for the white lid wa 42 degre celsiu . thi data show proof that darker color will increas the temperatur in the dog hous .
26601	10	0	1	dark grai the color affect the doghous becaus with dark grai the temperatur is kept the same instead of vari from on temp to the other . plu dog dont want it to be too cold in there doghous so i figur thei want a temperatur that will keep them warm and kinda chill
26602	10	1	1	black it will make the doghous realli hot .
26603	10	2	2	black by us black for the color of the doghous the insid of the hous will be warmer than the other color becaus darker color absorb more heat . accord to brandi and jerri s chart it is true becaus after 10 minut the black lit had the warmest air insid the jar .
26604	10	1	0	dark grai it will keep same temp . and will be too hot nor cold
26605	10	1	1	black it will make the doghous warmer insid which would be good for the wintertim so the dog isnt cold and miser .
26606	10	1	1	white the color will affect the doghous becaus it will make it a lot cooler in the doghous when the sun is out and it will look better
26607	10	0	0	white thei paint the color whit becaus it attract less sunlight .
26608	10	1	1	white white paint color becaus that wai the dog wont be hot instead it would be cool
26609	10	1	1	black it will heat the doghous up more than the other color .
26610	10	0	0	light grai ey
26611	10	1	1	black if the doghous is black it will absorb more energi then the other color . thi is appar in the test where the start temperatur for the glass jar wa 24 deg c and the black jar went up to 53 deg c while the white jar onli went up to 42 deg c .
26612	10	1	1	light grai it will make it slight cooler than hot . it will affect the doghous as make the doghous warm on cold dai and not to hot on hot dai .
26613	10	1	1	white that color would allow the doghous to be cooler and not so hot and stuffi .
26614	10	1	1	white white becaus it doesnt absorb as much heat as dark lid .
26615	10	2	2	light grai the color of light grai might affect the doghous by keep it the right temperatur not too cold or too hot becaus the darker the color the hotter it get and the lighter the color the c color it get accord too the data in which i got the inform .
26616	10	1	1	white the white color will make the doghous cooler so it wont be hot and stuffi .
26617	10	1	1	black if you had a doghous black then all the thermal enemi will go to it and be warmer for your dog . insid the doghous would be warm for your dog to live in . as it show in the data black wa with the highest temperatur .
26618	10	1	1	white if the doghous wa paint black and wa expos to the sun for to long it would get to it . now if it wa paint white the hous wont get to hot
26619	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai becaus the temperatur wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperatur for the dog .
26620	10	1	1	light grai the light grai onli attract 45 degre celli us and that is pretti warm . dure the winter the dog wont freez and dure the summer it wont sweat a lot .
26621	10	1	1	dark grai the color will affect the doghous by keep it warm in winter and not so hot in summer .
26622	10	1	1	white white becaus if not you could overheat the dog you want to keep it cool
26623	10	2	2	white a white paint on the doghous might work the best for summer and accord to the data tabl the white color averag temperatur wa the lowest so it will be good for dai when it hot .
26624	10	0	0	white white so it doesnt get hot in there when it summer . caus darker color attract heat
26625	10	2	2	light grai thi color might affect the doghous becaus when the weather is warm outsid the doghous will stai cool but also be a bit warm . also when the weather is cold outsid the doghous will be warm but also a bit cool . i know thi becaus when the light grai lid wa us on the jar the temperatur insid the jar wa averag and stai cool . howev the lid wa also a bit warm . the lowest temperatur insid the glass jar with the light grai lid on wa 44 deg c while the highest wa 46 deg c which if thi is the same with the doghous will make the doghous feel like a great temperatur .
26626	10	1	1	white it would make it cooler insid becaus white reflect the sun rai and black absorb them .
26627	10	1	1	black the darker the color the warmer it will be insid of the doghous becaus darker color absorb more energi .
26628	10	2	2	light grai the best color to paint a doghous would be light grai becaus accord to the select light grai wa cooler than black by 8 deg and it wa 3 deg hotter than white which would allow the dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26629	10	1	1	black the insid of the doghous would be much warmer insid the doghous then the other color . the black attract more heat .
26630	10	2	2	white white paint would be best becaus it would keep the interior of the doghous cool . the white lid had an averag of 42 deg c while the black lid got up to 53 deg c . unless you want your dog to be too hot in hi or her doghous i suggest you paint it white . also white look much better on hous than black dark grei or light grei .
26631	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai might effect the side by the temper becaus the start temper in the experi wa 24 degre and it end up be 48 degre each time
26632	10	2	2	light grai us alight grai paint on a doghous will help keep it warm insid on cold dai and cool insid on warm dai so the dog is alwai comfort . i would pick light grai for the color becaus it had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c insid the glass jar and that is a nice even temperatur for cold and warm dai .
26633	10	1	1	black thei should paint the doghous black becaus that on averag had the highest temperatur of 53 deg c . which wa 5 deg c higher than the second warmest roof color of dark grai and 11 deg c higher than the coldest roof color white .
26634	10	1	1	dark grai it wont be too hot or too cold .
26635	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai
26636	10	2	2	dark grai the white paint would reflect all of the light rai therefor keep the doghous cooler for the dog to escap the heat . the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c air temperatur insid the jar after 10 minut but the white lid had and averag of 42 deg c air temperatur insid the jar after 10 minut . thi is a differ of 11 deg c . the white doghous would keep a dog cooler than ani other color of paint .
26637	10	2	2	white the color white will affect the doghous by in the summer when it is hotter outsid the white wont absorb to much heat keep the doghous cooler . the averag temperatur for the white lip wa 42 the coolest temper and the averag for black wa 53 the highest the lower the number the cooler it is . white would beth best choic for the doghous .
26638	10	1	1	black black is the best color becaus it increas the air temperatur so the dog wont be cold .
26639	10	2	2	light grai us light grai would keep the temperatur at an even or equal rate . if it wa cold it wouldnt keep it as warm but not super cold either . if it wa hot outsid the doghous would keep aorta cool but not extrem hot either . the averag of black is a high at 53 degre . which is super hot . then white would be too cold at an averag temp at 42 degre .
26640	10	0	0	white the white paint will keep the doghous warm in the winter but wont be too hot in the summer . the averag temperatur of the white lid wa 42 deg c . thi wai the dog will be comfort in the hous with the white paint color .
26641	10	1	1	light grai light grai might affect the doghous becaus it will absorb everi make the insid warm for the dog . sinc the color doesnt absorb all of the energi the doghous will still be cool compar to have the paint black and keep all of the energi in . light grai paint will absorb onli a certain amount of energi .
26642	10	1	1	black white becaus it wa less heat in min . also the tempter onli got to around 40 45 deg
26643	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it would keep the dog hous warm and still a littl bit cool for the dog temperatur . the temperatur stai to an averag of 45 deg c .
26644	10	2	1	white white paint will keep the insid of the dodo us cool becaus in their experi the temperatur of the white wa 42 deg c it will keep the dog comfort .
26645	10	1	1	black in the summer it can make the insid of the dog hous hot .
26646	10	0	0	white dark color will seem confus just keep it white
26647	10	2	2	white brandi and jerri should design a doghous with the color white becaus the white lid averag air temperatur in the jar wa onli 42 deg c the lowest temperatur of all the lid . thi would make the doghous have a lower temperatur when expos to light to keep the dog cooler . as you can seeth averag air temperatur in the jar for the white lid wa onli 42 deg c as compar to the black lid which had an averag of 53 deg c . thi is an increas in 11 deg c a clear increas of air temperatur in the jar from the white to the black lid and therefor show that with the white paint the air temperatur within the doghous when expos to light will beth lowest compar to all other paint color test .
26648	10	1	2	white the color will reflect most of the heat and the insid of the doghous will stai cooler . in the experi the temperatur of the jar with the white lid onli wa rais an averag of 16 deg c .
26649	10	2	2	white by paint the doghous white the temperatur in the doghous will not be that high . accord to the experi us a white lid will keep the temperatur insid the jar low . so by paint the doghous white the temperatur in the doghous will stai low .
26650	10	1	1	dark grai thi color will absorb enough energi to where the air temperatur is comfort and not veri cold or veri hot .
26651	10	1	1	white the best color for the doghous will be white becaus of the result both brandi and jerri did white seem to beth color that is wai more cooler than ani other color by thi i mean in averag temperatur for the color white wa 42 deg c which mean that the dog will feel fresh be insid the doghous everydai it not to cold but not to warm either .
26652	10	1	1	light grai black hold heat in so it would be to hot and white hardli hold ani heat . so light grai can still hold heat while give the dog that nice cool feel .
26653	10	2	2	light grai brandi and jerri should paint their doghous light grai becaus it wont absorb as much heat energi as the darker color . in the data is show that the black lid got the hottest 53 deg c while the light grai lid onli reach 45 deg c . it will still collect heat to keep the doghous warm but not as much as the darker color .
26654	10	1	1	light grai light grai is a good color becaus it will keep the insid of the doghous not so hotter and not so cold it will keep it warm . when the sun hit the god hous it will not make it realli hot as it would if it were black or dark grai .
26655	10	2	2	black i chose black becaus black make it hotter nd that will affect the doghous by make it hotter . . . . in the experi it show that black is hotter .
26656	10	0	0	white it wont effect it at all becaus white dont absorb to much energi and wont case ani heat like black will
26657	10	1	1	black if thei us the darkest color avail then it absorb the heat energi better so that when the dog us the doghous it will be warm .
26658	10	2	2	white the paint color that thei should us is white . thi is becaus the averag temperatur of the white lid wa 42 deg while the averag temperatur for the other color were 45 48 and 53 deg . thi show that the white lid wa 11 deg degre color on averag than the black lid . therefor the dog would stai cooler and more comfort in the white hous wherea he could becom too hot in the black on .
26659	10	1	2	light grai it wont make the dog hot or cold becaus it in between . the highest temperatur would be to hot becaus it 54 deg and the lowest would be to cold which is 41 deg and light grai is in the middl of both the temperatur so it not too hot or cold .
26660	10	0	1	black if the doghous had a black roof it would benefit the dog in all kind of weather . for exampl in the wintertim or when it is cold out the black roof keep all of the dog bodi heat in the hous instead of wast it . and in the summer when it hot hell be outsid plai and hi doghous temperatur wont matter that much .
26661	10	1	1	black it would make the doghous warmer .
26662	10	1	1	light grai the doghous would not get too hot
26663	10	0	0	light grai you dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler insid . it will be about 45 deg c
26664	10	1	1	white white will keep the dog cool in the summer . so the doghous wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfort abli for the dog . in the winter it will just be a normal temperatur .
26665	10	1	1	white white becaus it hold the least amount of heat .
26666	10	0	0	light grai well i pick light grai becaus i wouldnt want too much energi in my dog hous if i had to pick a color . most dog goe in their hous so thei can either cool off or to relax .
26667	10	0	1	light grai light grai will beth best color to paint for the doghous becaus it wouldnt attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark grai would .
26668	10	0	0	dark grai the light grei color of the doghous would make it neutral insid becaus it stai the same throughout each experi .
26669	10	1	1	black the sun absorb more energi in the color . make the insid of the doghous hot amp warm .
26670	10	1	1	dark grai i think it should be dark grai becaus when it summer the color will absorb heat so he cant sai nice and warm and cool at the same time . .
26671	10	2	2	black if thei paint the doghous black then it will be hotter insid the doghous becaus the darker the color the more heat it will absorb . exampl the black lid creat the hottest air temperatur in the jar .
26672	10	1	1	white the best color to paint a doghous is white becaus white keep the doghous less warmer
26673	10	1	1	black a black doghous will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold . a white doghous will make it colder than all of the other color .
26674	10	1	1	white the darker the color is the hotter it will be insid . the lighter the color is it will not be as not insid .
26675	10	2	2	white the color white will effect the insid of the doghous becaus it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot . for exampl when the white lid wa place under the lamp it heat up to about 42 deg c but when the black lid wa place under the lamp it heat up to about 53 deg c .
26676	10	2	2	white white will attract less heat . i sai thi becaus it had the lowest averag of 42 deg that 1 deg less than grai 6 deg less that dark grei and 11 deg less than black .
26677	10	1	1	light grai well if the color is to dark then the doghous would be to hot sous a color the might not make the do hous to
26678	10	0	0	black i think black would beth best for the color of a doghous becaus darker color absorb more energi and black is the darkest on
26679	10	0	0	dark grai brandi and jerri should pant their doghous dark grai . i think thei should paint the doghous dark grai becaus in the experi hot lamp the averag of the averag in that experi wa 57 and the closest temperatur of the averag in that experi is the dark grai lid .
26680	10	0	0	white becaus in the graph is sai the averag is 4 2 and that why i pick white caus differ chemic .
26681	10	2	2	white the color white will affect the doghous by chang the temperatur and make it much cooler in the doghous . in the experi it show that the color white wa much colder thant e other color thei test edit wa an averag of 42 when black wa c
26682	10	1	1	black the color will keep the doghous temperatur warmer . the black color will absorb the heat of the dai and keep the doghous warm at night .
26683	10	1	1	white white would beth best becaus then the dog would not get too hot .
26684	10	2	2	black the color black would increas air temperatur insid the doghous . thi is model in the experi becaus when the lid on the jar wa black it had an averag insid air temperatur of 53 deg c and when the lid color wa white the air temperatur insid wa onli an averag of 42 deg c . so thi show that when the color black is us instead of white you will have an averag air temperatur increas of 11 deg c .
26685	10	2	2	black in the experi the jar with the black lid wa on averag 53 deg c after be expos to the lamp for ten minuet . the dark grei lid wa onli 48 deg c 5 deg c less than that of the black lid . the jar with a white lid wa onli 42 deg c 11 deg c less than the jar with the black lid . to warm up the doghous by just the sunlight brandi and jerri should paint the doghous black to increas the temperatur within the doghous . compar to the result with the jar the black paint would absurd the sunlight and warm up the doghous more than paint it white as with the jar experi the black lid warm up the jar 11 deg c more than the jar with the white lid .
26686	10	2	2	white i would choos white becaus white doe not absorb a lot of light so there for when it is hot outsid your dog will not get to hot insid of it doghous . i choos the color white becaus in the experi it show that the averag temperatur for the white lid wa 42 and for the black lid it wa 53 . that is an 11 deg c differ between the two color . so fora doghous i highli consid it be white .
26687	10	2	2	light grai the light grai will make the dog hous not too cold and not too hot for the dog . the averag temperatur would probabl be around 40 50 deg becaus the light grai lid on the jar had an averag 45 deg c but a doghous is a differ size from ajar so the temp true will vari a littl .
26688	10	2	2	white the best color for the doghous is white . thi is becaus accord to brandi and jerri experi the white doghous give the least amount of heat into the doghous . for the black doghous the averag temperatur would be 53 deg c for the dark grei doghous the averag temperatur would be 48 deg c for the light grei doghous the temperatur would be 45 deg c and the white doghous would have a temperatur 42 deg c . accord to thi data the best color fora doghous would be white .
26689	10	1	1	white if the dark the color the hotter it get why not choos white to keep the dog nice and cool in some wai .
26690	10	0	0	white white is the best color for the doghous becaus darker color absorb more heat when it warm or hot out . but whiter effect all of that heat energi
26691	10	2	2	dark grai the reason that i select dark grai as the optim color for the doghous is becaus out of all the color dark grai seem to beth middl temperatur . thi temperatur will affect the doghous by make it hotter in the winter when the sun shine on it and c color then black in the summer becaus it is a lighter shade than black . thi will occur from the dark grai paint becaus in the experi the us of the black lid made the air temperatur insid the jar an averag of 53 deg . the us of a white lid in the experi made the air temper natur insid the jar an averag of 42 deg . the us of alight grai lid made the air temperatur insid the jar an averag of 45 deg and the us of a dark grai lid made the air temperatur insid the jar 48 deg . thi show that dark grai is the middl temperatur and ideal fora doghous becaus it temperatur wa 6 deg hotter than the coolest tempor ar and 5 deg cooler then the hottest temperatur make dark grai medium in temperatur and optim fora doghous .
26692	10	1	1	dark grai that color dark grai might affect the dog hous by absorb heat caus it is a dark color but not as dark black so it wont absorb so munch heat .
26693	10	2	2	white the best paint color for the doghous is white becaus the white color for the lid doe not get as hot as the other c color so it wont be realli hot insid the doghous . accord to the air temperatur black averag wa 53 c deg dark grai averag 48 c deg light grai averag 45 c deg and the white averag 42 c deg
26694	10	1	1	white i pick white becaus it will make the dog hous colder even when the sun hit it
26695	10	2	2	white i would choos to paint the doghous white . the reason that i would paint the doghous white is becaus the insid of the doghous would then be cooler rather than if you were paint it black . the averag air temperatur when us white after 10 minut wa 42 deg c rather then when us black after 10 minut it wa 53 deg c . thi ha an overwhelm differ of 11 deg c after just 10 minut
26696	10	2	2	black thi color black will help the doghous stai becom warmer . sinc the doghous is outsid and for the most part it pretti cold outsid the doghous should be black so that the dog who live in the doghous can stai warm . black will do thi the most becaus it absorb energi better . after the 10 minut in the experi black wa the darkest color and had an averag temperatur of 53 degre calcium . after the 10 minut in the experi white wa the lightest color and had an averag temperatur of 42 degre calcium . so thi prove that the darker the color the more energi it will absorb make the object warmer .
26697	10	0	0	black the color will keep the doghous cooler in the hot summer
26698	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai becaus it will attract enough heat to keep it warm in the doghous .
26699	10	0	0	white i pick thi color becaus it so bright .
26700	10	0	0	dark grai the color would keep the doghous at a event matur but it wouldnt realli matter becaus it not a close system . the jar had a lid so it left in heat but a doghous would let the heat out so the doghous is a open system .
26701	10	2	2	white the temperatur insid the white doghous will be much cooler then the air temperatur outsid . becaus in the experi the result from all the test show that the white color lid wa much cooler the the rest of the color us so it would be more reason to us the white color paint to paint the doghous .
26702	10	1	1	light grai it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool becaus it is alight grai
26703	10	2	2	black if thei choos to paint the doghous black it will affect it by absorb more heat energi . in the investig the averag temperatur for the black lid wa 53 deg c versu the white which had an averag of 42 deg c . therefor if brandi and jerri paint the doghous black it will absorb more heat energi than the other color .
26704	10	2	2	light grai the best paint color for the doghous would be light grei . thi becaus the light grei would keep the doghous not as hot dure like the summer and warm enough dure the winter . from brandi and jerri s previou experi you can see with darker color on the lid like black and dark grei it made the jar temperatur hotter so if you us it on the doghous it would make it too warm insid . with the light grei it would be not to hot or cold . anoth choic would beth white but that might make the doghous to cold in the winter so light grei is the best choic .
26705	10	1	1	white it absorb less heat
26706	10	1	1	black the color would keep the doghous warmer be us the averag wa 53 minut after the light wa turn off so the dog would stai warmer compar to white which wa onli and averag of 42 minut after the light turn off .
26707	10	2	2	light grai light grai would beth best color for the doghous becaus it would not be too hot or too cold becaus in the expir went the jar with light grai lid had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c after 10 minut under the heat lamp which wa not as cold as the white lid 42 deg c and the light grei lid did not have as hot of an averag air temperatur after 10 minut under the heat lamp as the dark grai lid 48 deg c or the black lid which wa 53 deg c . with the light grei roof the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it doghous .
26708	10	2	2	white it wa the lid color that had the coolest temperatur . it wa 42 deg c 43 deg c 41 deg c and 42 deg c .
26709	10	2	2	black the color black might affect the insid oft he doghous becaus the color black absorb more energi compar to the other color . i think thi becaus in the data from the experi the averag air temperatur insid the glass jar after ten minut for the lid color black wa 53 deg c . the dark grai lid color averag air temperatur insid the glass jar after ten minut wa 48 deg c the air temperatur for light grai wa 45 deg c and the averag air temperatur for the lid color white wa 42 deg c . overal the conclus you could draw from that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energi than the other color . in the experi the black lid had a differ in averag from the coldest air temperatur the white lid by 11 deg c .
26710	10	0	0	light grai mayb someth els wa alreadi that color
26711	10	0	1	black black might affect it becaus the darker the color the the more energi it absorb .
26712	10	0	1	light grai thei would choos light grai becaus thei want the doghous to beth right temperatur for the dog to stai in without be to hot and light grai is the perfect te captur for the dog .
26713	10	1	1	white that color will effect the doghous becaus the doghous will not be hot in the summer it will stai cool in the there .
26714	10	1	1	black black if you live ina cold place and want the doghous to stai warm .
26715	10	1	0	dark grai in winter the doghous will stai warm in the summer the doghous will stai cool .
26716	10	1	1	black in the summer the doghous will be hot but in the winter the doghous will be warmer becaus black attract heat .
26717	10	1	1	white i choos white becaus if it wa black dark grai or light grai it will get hotter becaus of the densiti of hot .
26718	10	0	0	dark grai becaus dog can onli see light grai or dark grai and it more easier for him to see hi doghous
26719	10	0	0	black the color might affect the doghous becaus it is a dark color . . . . .
26720	10	2	1	dark grai i think that brandi and jerri should us dark grei for the doghous paint color . dark grei would keep the temperatur between the highest and the lowest temperatur . dark grei would beth best becaus the black doghous would get to hot for the dog at an averag at 53 deg c and the white doghous would be to cold for the dog at ana averag of 42 deg c so i pick the dark grei doghous becaus it wa in the middl at 48 deg c . the light grei hous would be my next choos at an averag of 45 deg c . the light grei and dark grei doghous ar onli 3 deg c awai from each other and i pick the dark grei becaus if it got colder the doghous would still stai warm enough for the dog .
26721	10	1	1	black black would be a good becaus it is a dark color and dark color absorb heat so when the doghous is made it will be warm for the dog .
26722	10	0	0	white white
26723	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai would beth best for the lid tom ar it sleep light
26724	10	1	1	light grai light grai is not too cold but not too hot . rememb most dog have a lot of hair on their bodi to keep them warm . amp so you dont want a doghous that get too hot like the black doghous caus the sun absorb in darker color . if a dog get too cold in the doghous provid blanket food amp water . fora healthi en torment . also if you see it a nice dai outsid let the dog plai around dont make it get coop up insid .
26725	10	1	1	white if you paint the doghous white it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the doghous black becaus the color black attract heat more than the color white doe so if you paint it black the dog would be realli warm .
26726	10	1	0	white i choos white becaus black and grai suck in a lot of heat and white reflect it so white is less hot .
26727	10	1	1	light grai you d probabl want alight grai so that in the summer the hous is cool and in the winter it warm
26728	10	0	0	dark grai it would make the doghous a good temperatur
26729	10	1	1	light grai light grai doesnt wont make the doghous too hot or too cold . the doghous would be both warm and cool down .
26730	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai is best becaus the temperatur stai the same
26731	10	2	1	white white ha the least temperatur on the data tabl and it is the lightest color . like their hypothesi said darker color absorb more heat than lighter color . so white is the lightest color there is . so that mean that the white doghous wont absorb ani heat like the black dark grai and light grai doghous .
26732	10	1	1	dark grai i would sai dark grai becaus if it wa cold it would keep the doghous warm and if it wa hot the doghous would be warm insid .
26733	10	1	1	dark grai caus darker the color more it attract heat
26734	10	2	2	light grai brandi and jerri should paint the doghous light grei becaus light grei absorb more heat than white but it absorb less heat than black and dark grei . light grai would be perfect becaus dure the summer the light grai would absorb some heat but not a lot so the doghous wouldnt be too warm . dure the winter the light grai would absorb some heat so that the doghous wont be too cold dure the winter . i know thi becaus in the experi that brandi and jerri did where thei found out how the color of an object affect it temperatur thei found that the averag temperatur of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minut wa 53 deg c . the averag temperatur of the glass jar with the dark grai lid after 10 minut wa 48 deg c . the averag temperatur of the glass jar with the light grai lid after 10 minut wa 45 deg c . final the averag temperatur of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minut wa 42 deg c . thi show that light grai absorb some heat but not a lot so light grai would beth perfect color fora doghous .
26735	10	1	1	white if the color white is us on the doghous it would reflect the sun light caus the insid of the doghous to be cooler than if it wa paint with a darker color paint .
26736	10	1	1	white white would best fit the doghous becaus it help the hous cool down then the dog wouldnt be so hot or warm .
26737	10	2	2	dark grai the dark grai would be better for the dog hous becaus it not to hot but not to cold . the black would be to hot becaus the averag wa 53 deg c but the light grai and white ar to cold with the light grai averag at 45 deg c and white at 42 deg c . so in thi case the dark grai is the right color for the doghous with the averag of 48 deg c .
26738	10	0	0	black how hot it will get
26739	10	0	1	white i go with white becaus then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedai becaus most of the trial were differ .
26740	10	0	0	white thei should paint the doghous white . if the doghous wa whitman it wa a sunni dai then the dog would be hot . dog cant sweat .
26741	10	2	2	black black will be a good color for the doghous becaus it attract heat and it will keep the dog warm in it doghous . the averag temperatur for the color black is 53 degre and the averag temperatur for the lightest color white is 42 degre though black is better becaus it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm rather than cold .
26742	10	1	1	dark grai it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26743	10	1	1	white the darker the color the hotter the air in the doghous
26744	10	1	1	white white would be a good color for the doghous becaus it doesnt absorb as much heat as black . thi would make it cooler so the dog wouldnt be too hot
26745	10	2	2	black if it is cold outsid and there is still some sun the color would absorb the sun make the doghous a littl warmer for the dog to stai in . give a dog a water atmospher would be better to have it cold and freez . brandi and jerri did an experi where thei test color black dark grai light grai amp white and black had an averag of 53 degre c . while compar to the white which wa 42 degre c that is 12 degre apart from the black .
26746	10	1	1	dark grai it would keep the doghous warm but not to warm becaus dark grai is a dark color
26747	10	1	1	white i think that white would effect the doghous becaus it had the lowest number in the data tabl
26748	10	0	0	light grai the light grai color will keep the room both cool and warm at the same time
26749	10	2	2	light grai black absorb more heat therefor it will be too warm in the doghous white on the other hand absorb less heat as you can see on the data tabl . dure trial 1 white wa 42 deg while black wa 54 deg . so if the roof is white the dog will too cool . therefor the doghous should be light grei it is a happi medium . on cool dai it will still be warm becaus grei absorb more heat than white and on hot dai it wont be too hot becaus grei absorb less heat then black .
26750	10	2	1	white the dog have fur and when it hot the white will reflect the heat from go insid and keep the dog cool in the experi the white got cool then the other
26751	10	1	2	dark grai if brandi and jerri paint the doghous dark grai then when the dog would be insid the doghous it would not be hot but it would not be cold either . from the investig for the air temperatur the averag of all the averag combin is 47 . the closest color to that temperatur is dark grei . therefor the color dark grei is just the right temperatur becaus it not too not and not too cold . the dog insid the doghous would be perfect in thi temperatur .
26752	10	2	2	black if the paint on the doghous is black then the insid of the doghous will be warmer . the air in the jar wa alwai warmer when the black lid wa on it . the dog will stai warm ina black doghous .
26753	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai would beth best paint color for the doghous becaus in all the trial the dark grai lid chang the air temperatur in the jar to 48 deg c . the light grai lid chang the air in the jar to 44 deg c in the first trial 45 deg c in the second trial and 46 deg c in the third trial . dark grai would kept the doghous the same temperatur wherea the light grai temperatur would vari .
26754	10	1	1	white if you have a white hous le heat will beat act to the hous becaus it is a lighter color but to a black hous more heat will be attract
26755	10	1	1	black it will make the air insid the doghous warmer if the color is darker
26756	10	1	1	light grai the color might affect the doghous becaus dark color attract sunlight so black would be hottest then dark grai would be hotter then light grai and light grai would be hotter then white . white would have the coldest temperatur in the doghous and black would beth hottest .
26757	10	1	1	white white would beth best choic for the dog hous becaus dark color like black and dark grai absorb a lot of energi and it will be hotter so therefor make a white doghous and the dog would be in cooler temp
26758	10	1	1	light grai well darker color absorb more heat make the doghous a lighter color will keep it cool but also warm but not to warm
26759	10	2	2	white white becaus the jar with the white jar lid stai the coolest and onli got up to about 42 deg c . so the doghous would stai cooler if you paint it white .
26760	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous becaus black attract the sun with make lot of heat and high temperatur
26761	10	0	1	black becaus darker color abov more energi y .
26762	10	1	1	black black becaus dark color absorb more energi
26763	10	1	1	white becaus thee darker the color of someth the more heat is attract to it .
26764	10	1	1	light grai it the median temperatur from the experi so the doghous temperatur would be abl to stai warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather .
26765	10	1	1	light grai the color will keep the dog warmer in the winter but wont make the doghous hot in the summer .
26766	10	1	1	dark grai us the dark grai paint would be best becaus it wa closest to the averag temperatur of all of the color . the doghous temperatur would be warm which is good for the winter and most season .
26767	10	2	2	black black paint well keep the doghous warmer becaus the black lid wa averag 54 deg c ware as white paint wa onli 42 deg c . so there would bean averag of about 12 deg c differ between the white and black paint .
26768	10	2	2	black the darker the color the more heat or light is absorb make it warmer . and in the experi black made the air of the jar the warmest . the heat from the top of the doghous will heat up the doghous
26769	10	0	1	dark grai thi color will effect the temperatur of the dog hous becaus the temperatur doesnt chang most of the time . the dark grai color keep the temperatur the same and it keep it nice and cool for the dog .
26770	10	0	0	light grai black is too dark and it will make the dog deg press and the white is too light it will be dirti so soon so grai color will not make it dirti soon and depress . it will make the dog hyper and more excit .
26771	10	1	1	dark grai becaus it give the insid of the doghous a warm fell insid that would confer the dog
26772	10	2	2	white the color white would beth best choic when paint a doghous becaus it would keep the dog cooler on when insid than ani of the other color choic . the averag temperatur when test white paint in the experi wa 42 deg c . which is 11 deg c cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which ha an averag of 53 deg c . prove perfectli why choos white paint is the best choic .
26773	10	0	0	black it will make it absorb more energi
26774	10	2	1	dark grai the color dark grai becaus it would keep the doghous cool for the dog becaus the averag temp . wa 48 deg
26775	10	2	2	white the white will keep the doghous cooler when it is hot outsid . sinc the temperatur wa lowest when the white lid wa on the jar the temperatur in the doghous will be cooler with a white doghous .
26776	10	2	2	white becaus it doesnt get as hot at black dark grei or light grai the averag for the white lid is 42 deg c the averag for the black is 53 deg c the averag for the dark grei is 48 deg c and the averag for the light grei is 45 deg c so there for white is the best color for the doghous becaus it doesnt get as hot as the other color
26777	10	2	2	white the insid of the doghous will be cooler becaus white had the lowest temperatur . at 42 degre celsiu
26778	10	0	0	white well dog like light color so thei will us it more often .
26779	10	1	1	white white might beth best color for the doghous becaus of it low heat intak . with the dog have longhair it wouldnt beth best decis to have a black doghous where it would alwai get hot . so with a white doghous the dog could be more comfort ina less hot doghous .
26780	10	1	1	dark grai if brandi and jerri made a doghous the best color to paint it would be dark grai . dark grai would be best becaus it absorb heat so the dog wont be cold if it goe insid but it isnt as dark as black so if the dog want to be cooler it can us the doghous .
26781	10	0	0	dark grai the doghous would not be too hot in the summer if you did a dark grai also if you chose alight grai it could be cold in the winter so there for dark grai would beth best color .
26782	10	2	2	white the doghous should be white becaus then the temperatur insid the doghous would not rise as much on a sunni dai becaus accord to experi and the data tabl lid color vs . air temperatur the glass jar with the white lid wa the least affect by light . for exampl the averag temperatur insid the glass jar with the white lid after ten minut wa 42 deg c while the averag temperatur insid the glass jar with the black lid after ten minut wa 53 deg c .
26783	10	1	1	white the color white mai affect the doghous becaus dure the summer it mai reach high temperatur and the color white effect the sun . make the doghous less hot .
26784	10	2	2	white the averag air temperatur of the jar with a white lid wa 41 deg c . with the paint color as white the air temperatur in the doghous wont get as hot . with a black lid in the previou experi the averag air temperatur wa 53 deg c which is hotter than the white lid by 12 deg c .
26785	10	1	1	light grai so it wont get to hot or too cold
26786	10	0	0	white it would affect the temperatur insid of it .
26787	10	1	1	white becaus it is said to no contract heat or absorb
26788	10	0	0	white i chose white caus it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other on will just attract heat and the sun .
26789	10	1	1	light grai it would affect the doghous by keep it cool . a dog that is activ and doe a lot of run the dog would not want to got to a doghous that is paint black becaus that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stai too hot to cool off .
26790	10	1	1	black it would keep the doghous warm becaus the color will attract the heat which will keep the hous warm .
26791	10	1	1	white thi color wont make the doghous to hot to the highest temperatur . the temperatur of the white doghous will be just right on a dog especi after more than 10 minut .
26792	10	1	1	dark grai accord to the experi black would bet he best and most effici color in the pretens that you would want it to be warm insid the doghous that is . but the case is dure the summer it get veri warm and what happen if you paint the dog hous blackwel that color magnifi the sun heat and you would indirectli scorch your poor dog . usual though the heat here is cold and not hot so the best color for the doghous would be dark grai becaus dure the summer and heat your dog wouldnt be too hot and dure the colder time it will still keep the heat in well .
26793	10	2	2	white if the color of the doghous is white thi will keep the hous cool . accord to the experi the black lid increas the air temperatur by 29 deg c in 10 minut while the white lid onli increas it by 18 deg c .
26794	10	1	1	dark grai the darker a color is the more heat energi it attract so the dark grei would attract not much heat energi to where it to hot but it wont be to cold either .
26795	10	1	1	dark grai i think dark grai would beth best color for the doghous becaus out of all the other color thi wa the onli on with the same temperatur throughout the trial . it wouldnt be too cold or too hot .
26796	10	0	0	black the color mai effect the doghous becaus it darker then ani other other color
26797	10	1	1	white white will keep the doghous cold .
26798	10	2	2	white white would beth best color for the doghous becaus the lighter the color is the less light it will attract . the reason black dark grei or light grei wouldnt work is in the tabl it show for the averag black is 53 and that is just to high dark grai is 48 and that is also pretti warm light grai is 45 and that is a littl cooler than the dark grai but not much and then it show white and white is 42 and that wa the coolest of all the color becaus is attract less heat .
26799	10	2	2	white by paint the doghous white it would make the doghous cooler insid than paint it black dark grai or light grai becaus in the data it show that the averag temperatur of the air in the jar that had the white lid wa 42 deg c and the averag temperatur for the air insid the jar that had the black lid wa 53 deg c . by paint the doghous white there would be a differ in heat of 11 deg c than paint the doghous black . therefor paint the doghous white would beth best choic of color to paint the doghous becaus it would keep it the coolest temperatur .
26800	10	2	2	white if the doghous is white it will not becom as hot as if it were paint black . the jar with the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c under the lamp . howev the jar with the white lid had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c
26801	10	2	2	black i think the black paint would work best becaus it absorb the most heat out of the four color . the averag temperatur wa 53 degre which wa five degre higher than the dark grai eight degre higher than the light grai and eleven degre higher than the white paint .
26802	10	1	0	dark grai dark grei becaus in the winter the dog might get cold soft would be warmth insid of the doghous for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in it doghous it will probabl want to layout in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t em return to sleep in the doghous .
26803	10	2	2	white the white paint would make the insid of the doghous cool and not hot becaus dark color absorb more energi as said in the text and bright color dont .
26804	10	1	1	white the white would make it cooler insid so in the summer it wouldnt be hot
26805	10	2	2	white you should us white becaus the dog probabl ha enough fur to last through wine so you would want to keep as much heat out as possibl dure the summer i sai thi becaus accord to the test result the averag air heat from black wa 53 deg c the averag for dark grai wa 48 deg c the averag for light grai wa 45 deg c and the averag for white wa 42 deg c . so in conclus the white paint is 11 deg c cooler than black paint .
26806	10	1	1	white white ha the least air temperatur 42 and so there will be less air temperatur affect on the doghous .
26807	10	1	1	black black becaus the color might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker it will affect the doghous becaus the hous mai becom warm insid by the heat the black is bring to it
26808	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai will be a cool and warm c color for the doghous . in all 3 trial it onli got up to be 48 deg c and the black got up to 54 deg c
26809	10	1	1	white it affect the insid of the doghous becaus if white is the color outsid then on the insid it will be much cooler than black or dark grai sinc darker color absorb more heat .
26810	10	1	1	light grai the color would affect the doghous by not get to hot in th summer and not get to cold in the winter .
26811	10	2	2	white the white would not be hot so the dog can not burn up . the temperatur wa 42 deg and the right wa the black at 53 deg . the di went ci es would be 11 deg .
26812	10	2	2	black that color will affect the doghous warm the insid of the doghous becaus in the data the color black wa rang in from 52 deg c 54 deg c and the lighter color were in the 40 deg c
26813	10	0	0	light grai it best . it not that dark and that light .
26814	10	2	2	white it will keep the dog cooler in the summer . in each test the white lid wa proven to stai the coolest the data show that white ha the lowest temperatur at 42 for trial 1 43 for trial 2 41 for trial 3 and 42 for trial 4 .
26815	10	0	0	black it wa hotter outsid
26816	10	0	0	white the white is not dark and not light white is between that .

26819	10	1	1	light grai it a lighter color and then it wont be that hot .
26820	10	2	2	black black would beth best choic in colder climat washington becaus it absorb more heat . the dog would thu be warmer if it doghous wa paint black . insid the jar black averag temperatur is 53 deg c compar with white which s averag temperatur wa 42 deg c . that is a differ of 11 deg c .
26821	10	2	2	black if you us the color black then the insid of the doghous will have an increas in temperatur . accord to the experi a black lid had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . while the white lid had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c . therefor i can conclud that a darker color will caus an object to have a higher temperatur . which mean a black doghous will have a higher temperatur then a white doghous .
26822	10	0	0	black black affect the doghous becaus is gonna be to dark and he not donna want to stai in the .
26823	10	1	1	white how the color white would effect the doghous is if thei paint it white it would be cooler insid the doghous . and if thei paint it black it would be hotter . thei should paint the doghous white so the affect make the doghous cooler .
26824	10	2	2	black in the experi the black lid made the air hotter soto make the doghous hot thei should us the black lid for the lamp .
26825	10	1	1	black becaus in the winter the dog ha a better chanc of stai warm
26826	10	1	1	white white will not affect the doghous becaus the sun will not go to the doghous as black becaus black ask more the energi so the hothous will get hot as much as the color black .
26827	10	0	1	white have a white paint roof will reflect heat in the summer so the dog will not overheat insid it .
26828	10	2	2	white have a white color doghous will make the doghous cooler . thi is becaus white is a color that doesnt absorb heat as well as other color which will make the doghous cooler and more comfort for the dog . in the experi the air temperatur insid the jar wa 11 deg c cooler than the jar that wa black which prove that paint the doghous white will make the doghous cooler .
26829	10	1	1	black the sun will absorb the color black and the temperatur will rise
26830	10	0	0	light grai thi color would give the temperatur afresh breez in the hot summer dai amp the fall
26831	10	0	0	black the dog would not be al to see hi hous in the dark .
26832	10	2	1	white in thi experi it prove that out of all the color test white wa the best . white stai cool the whole time while other temperatur went up .
26833	10	1	1	white i dont think the color on the outsid would affect the insid of a doghous if your us a thicker materi like wood but to be safe i would still choos white so the hous would be colder
26834	10	2	2	black black will affect the doghous by make it hotter becaus the averag temperatur insid the doghous wa 53 deg c . the white will will not make it as hot becaus it averag temperatur wa 42 deg c .
26835	10	2	2	dark grai i think that thei should paint the doghous black becaus it absorb more sunlight and allow the hous to be warmer . the black had the highest temperatur that wa 54 degre and the white on had 41 degre .
26836	10	1	1	white white might make it colder in the winter than the spring black might it hot in the summer and winter the light grai as well
26837	10	1	1	white sinc white is such alight color it doesnt absorb so much energi and it cooler than the other color . cooler condit ar best fora dog in my opinion .
26838	10	2	2	white the white paint will keep the dog warm but not stifl hot . the paint had the lowest temp . of air in the lab as white doesnt attract heat like black doe
26839	10	2	2	white white paint will affect the insid of the doghous by make it cooler than it would be if the doghous wa a differ color . in the experi the white color had the lowest temperatur after 10 minut and wa 42 deg c . the light grai wa 45 deg c the dark grai wa 48 deg c and the black wa 53 deg c . sinc the white had the lowest temperatur it would keep the doghous coolest and therefor beth best to us .
26840	10	1	1	light grai the light grai becaus than i wont get to hot in the doghous when it sunni outsid becaus it wont absorb to much energi but when it cold outsid it will still be a littl warm becaus it absorb energi so it would alwai beth perfect temperatur for the dog
26841	10	0	0	white becaus the whit well not be as heat in the doghous unlik black becaus that well heat the whole doghous
26842	10	1	1	white brandi and jerri should us white becaus it absorb less heat than the darker color .
26843	10	2	2	dark grai the color might affect the doghous by make the insid temperatur warmer than the temperatur outsid by more than it would if you us white or light grei . becaus in the experi the dark grei absorb more heat get an averag of 48 degre c . compar to light grei 45 degre and white 42 . black absorb more energi at about 53 degre c . but the dog might cook if it sit in the doghous dure the summer .
26844	10	1	1	white becaus if u have a lighter color then the temperatur would be colder
26845	10	2	2	light grai i chose light grei becaus the insid of the doghous wouldnt be too hot for the dog or too cold . accord to the data the result of light grei had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c while the black paint would be too hot at an averag of 8776 53 deg c and the white paint could mayb be too cold with an averag temperatur of 42 deg c
26846	10	0	0	light grai if darker color absorb more heat then im guess that that mean it absorb cold temperatur too . soto keep it at an even balanc i would sai the color light grai is the best choic .
26847	10	2	2	black paint the doghous black would make thea ir insid it warmer . in brandi and jerri s experi the averag air temper of the can with a black lid wa 53 deg c wherea the dark grai wa onli 48 deg c the light grai wa onli 45 deg c and the white lid wa onli 42 deg c . therefor the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghous paint black will have the warmest inner temperatur .
26848	10	2	2	white if the color of the doghous is white then it would be colder insid the doghous and when it is warm and sunni outsid the dog in the doghous will not get to hot . the result from the experi support my decis becaus in the experi with a white lid the temperatur insid the glass jar wa 42 deg c and all the other temperatur averag were a higher temperatur than 42 deg c .
26849	10	1	2	dark grai in the experi the dark grai lid made the air temperatur insid the jar an averag of 48 deg c . if the doghous wa black the air temperatur would bean averag of 53 deg c . if the doghous wa white the averag temperatur would be 42 deg c . if the doghous wa dark grai then the dog wouldnt be too hot or too cold .
26850	10	1	1	black it would affect it by make the doghous more warm when the sun is out . the reason i would us thi color is becaus when it cold outsid dure the dai the black will absorb more energi from the sun and make it warmer for the dog .
26851	10	1	1	black in the daytim the doghous will be warmer
26852	10	0	0	white thi color through off more heat than the rest of them .
26853	10	1	1	white thi color might affect the doghous becaus the doghous might stai cool for the dog and thei wont burn up in the dark color .
26854	10	1	1	light grai dure the summer the doghous will stai al or cooler than it would with it paint black but in the winter it would be better to have light grai so that the doghous would be warmer .
26855	10	1	1	white i would choos white becaus you dont want the dog to get too warm .
26856	10	1	1	black that color might affect the doghous becaus it will keep the dog warm at night in case of the cold air . for exampl if it wa hot and i wa wear black i would be hot as well caus it a dark color and can affect my bodi temperatur and the heat on me and in the air .
26857	10	0	0	light grai i ant know
26858	10	1	1	light grai it will absorb some heat into the doghous so that the dog could stai warm at most time .
26859	10	2	2	white if the doghous wa paint white in the summer when it wa veri hot outsid then the dog would be abl togo into the doghous where it would be cool insid . i know thi becaus in the experi the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatur . the lighter the color the cooler it will be insid .
26860	10	1	0	dark grai it will make the doghous cold and look dark even dure the dai .
26861	10	0	0	black becaus it black
26862	10	2	2	light grai i chose light grai becaus then the doghous wont be too cold or too warm with light grai . light grai wa in the middl of the data . white would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot . the averag temperatur for white wa 42 deg c and the averag temperatur for black wa 53 deg c . light grai wa the perfect choic becaus it averag temperatur is 45 deg c .
26863	10	1	2	white in the data tabl it show the black lid held in more hot air then all the other lid black lid held in 54 deg c on trial 1 while the white lid held in 42 deg c in the first trail the black lid averag wa 53 deg c while the white lid averag wa 42 deg c by compar the data it show that the white lid hold in less air .
26864	10	2	2	white the best color to paint the doghous would be white becaus it attract the less heat in the trial the temperatur were 42 deg 43 deg 41 deg and 42 deg which make it the lowest t empti re out of all the color
26865	10	1	1	black it might effect it by us thi color it can make the doghous more warmer on summer dai .
26866	10	1	1	white well when it get hot in the summer the dog will be cooler and white goe with everyth .
26867	10	0	0	white white would reflect heat so the dog would not get veri hot
26868	10	0	0	light grai thei might not belabor to seeth thing
26869	10	0	0	dark grai that would help even it out .
26870	10	2	2	white white becaus you want your dog to be cool enough and accord to the lid color vs . air temperatur insid glass jar chart white is the coolest .
26871	10	2	2	dark grai i think that the color dark grei will affect the doghous by make it warmer but not too warm insid than if it wa a lighter or darker color . i think that becaus in the experi the darkest color black end up be the warmest at 53 deg dark grei wa the second warmest at 48 deg light grei wa next at 45 deg and white wa least warmest at 42 deg .
26872	10	2	2	white i would paint the doghous white becaus that color would keep the doghous cool . in the experi the jar with the white lid wa an averag temperatur of 42 deg c and the jar with the black lid had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c .
26873	10	2	2	white thei should make the doghous with a whiter of becaus that will keep the insid of the doghous cool instead of extrem hot . in their experi the averag fora white lid wa 42 deg c as oppos to the black lid which had an averag of 53 deg c . it would be a lot smarter to keep the insid of the doghous cool by us white paint so the dog ha somewher to cool off instead of us black paint so it is veri hot in the doghous and the dog will not want to be insid of the doghous at all .
26874	10	1	1	black becaus when is sunni the insid the doghous is go to be so hot
26875	10	1	1	dark grai i think dark grai is good becaus the t em return is 48 deg and that snot hot so the dog is not go to be hot . and 48 deg is not cold either it cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it ll be just right . but that s my opinion .
26876	10	2	2	black if thei were to paint the doghous black then the dog would stai warm . as in the experi it show that when thei us the black lid the temperatur went from 24 deg c to 53 deg c in 10 minut . and when thei us the white lid the temperatur went from 24 deg c to 42 deg c in 10 minut . thi show that the darker the color the greater increas in the air temperatur becaus the darker color absorb more energi .
26877	10	1	1	dark grai it would effect it becaus in the doghous it wouldnt be too hot and it wouldn t be to cold .
26878	10	1	1	white the color white would keep the doghous at a cooler temperatur
26879	10	1	1	dark grai how thi color might affect the doghous is that with black in the summer the doghous would get to hot insid and with white in the wintertim it would get to cold insid . i chose dark grei becaus it would not get to hot or to cold becaus of the weather .
26880	10	1	1	black black would affect the doghous becaus if it wa to hot the dog wouldnt have know where togo but the doghous the the doghous would be extrem hot
26881	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai becaus that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it to cold . it absorb just the right amount of sun so that it not to hot and not to cold .
26882	10	0	0	black black dont heist eat
26883	10	2	2	light grai light grai should beth cooler becaus in the summer it wont be so hot becaus in the data the averag temperatur is 45 degre calcium so it not to hot or to cold .
26884	10	1	0	dark grai the color wont absorb to much heat therefor it wont be to hot insid . the darker the color the greater the heat
26885	10	1	1	white you would want to paint it white becaus white doe not absorb as much heat as baker color would therefor keep the dog cooler in the summertim .
26886	10	2	2	white in the trail the white lid got the least hot so the doghous doe not get to hot thei should paint it white .
26887	10	0	0	black it would have more air in the doghous allow the dog to breath easier .
26888	10	1	1	white reflect more heat to keep the insid cooler in the summer
26889	10	2	2	black black would chang the temperatur of the doghous by make it warmer becaus black absorb heat to most . with the black lid the temperatur wa 53 deg c . with the white lid the temperatur wa 42 deg c . there wa 11 deg c differ .
26890	10	2	2	white i would sai white becaus in the experi the darker the color the hotter it got . and with white be the lightest color the dog would not get as hot .
26891	10	0	0	white becaus dog like to touch thing so thei mite do someth and make the lamp fall .
26892	10	0	1	white it would beth color that would attract the least amount of heat
26893	10	0	0	dark grai
26894	10	2	1	black the color black will affect the doghous in mani wai . for exampl it will be warm in there when it sunni outsid . the wai that i know thi is the temp of the black lid is 54 dirg then 52 dirg then back to 54 dirg so the averag temp is 53 dirg but for white the averag temp wa 42 so as you can see thi is how the color of the doghous affect the temp it will be warm in the doghous .
26895	10	1	1	light grai the color light grai would have to beth best color to paint the doghous . thei wouldnt want to us black becaus sinc black is a dark color till absorb more energi amp make the air temperatur rise high . so black wouldnt be a good color becaus thei wouldnt want the dog to get to hot . that is why i chose light grai becaus i think it just right to paint the doghous . with light grai the dog wouldnt be to hot or too cold . thei would be just right .
26896	10	0	0	dark grai when it rain or get cold the doghous will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
26897	10	1	1	white it would make it cooler caus the color isnt dark .
26898	10	1	1	light grai it is not too hot or too cold
26899	10	1	1	dark grai it might affect the doghous by ad heat but not too much heat and the temperatur will stai the same thought the dai when the sun hit on it . it would be a good color becaus you dont want the dog to get too hot .
26900	10	1	0	white the doghous would not get too hot in the summer becaus white doesnt attract as much heat from the sun .
26901	10	2	2	black black paint would make the insid of the doghous the warmest of all the paint color . in the experi it show that with a black lid on a glass jar the air temperatur will be 53 deg c on averag and with a white lid the air temperatur would be 42 deg c on averag . thi show that the black lid made the air warmer by 11 deg c and therefor black paint would make the insid of the doghous the warmest .
26902	10	2	2	white that color might help to keep the air temperatur lower sinc lighter color dont absorb as much energi as darker color like black or grai . thi wa proven in the experi becaus the averag air temperatur for white 42 deg wa lower than the averag temperatur for black and grai 45 deg 53 deg .
26903	10	1	1	light grai i think the best paint color is light grai becaus that wai the temperatur insid the doghous will be warmer than the outsid so it wont be too cold insid but it wont be too hot like a black roof might caus it to be
26904	10	1	1	black so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the summer so the dog wouldnt freez at night
26905	10	2	2	white a white doghous would absorb less energi and it temperatur would be cooler . in the experi the jar with the light white lid had a lower temperatur than the jar with the darkest black lid . a doghous paint white would therefor have a lower temperatur and the dog could us it to stai out of the sun and cool in summer .
26906	10	1	1	light grai that color will not effect the doghous becaus the light grai will not be to cold or to hot the the doghous and for the dog who is go to be therein the doghous
26907	10	1	1	black the doghous would be hotter becaus dark color like black absorb heat .
26908	10	2	2	black the color black would beth best color for the roof of a doghous becaus accord to the result from the experi the air temperatur insid is higher compar to other color .
26909	10	2	2	black black would be good fora doghous roof becaus in brandi and jerri trial black heat up the warmest with black at an averag of 53 deg and the other three color onli in the forti deg rang . so therefor if you have a darker roof the doghous will be warmer fort he dog .
26910	10	1	1	white thi color might affect the doghous by keep it cool insid for the dog when it get to hot in the summer and want togo somewher where it not so hot
26911	10	2	2	white the best color to paint the doghous would be white becaus in the experi the white lid didnt get as hot as the black lid . the black lid reach an averag of 53 deg c but the white lid onli reach 42 deg c . also with a white giant on the doghous instead of be realli hot the doghous will be veri cool
26912	10	0	0	black if the doghous wa black it would attract more light from the sun to the doghous which would keep the dog warmer when it outsid .
26913	10	2	2	white if thei us the white paint for the doghous then on the insid of the doghous it wont be as hot as if it were paint black or the two shade of grai . the shade of grai and the black paint caus the jar to at least getup to 45 deg c and at the most the jar got to 53 deg c so brandi and jerri would be best of us the white paint for the doghous becaus in the experi the jar onli got to 42 deg c when thei us the white lid .
26914	10	1	1	dark grai if the doghous is dark grai then the hous will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold night but also not to much heat so that the dog stai cool on hot dai becaus the darker the color the more heat that is absorb . if the color is not complet black then not to much heat energi will be absorb .
26915	10	1	1	white white becaus dog like to be cool like how thei ar alwai pant thei do that so the cool down so if it wa black then the dog would be wai to hot .
26916	10	1	1	dark grai by paint the doghous dark grai it would affect the insid of the hous becaus it would keep it warm while not over heat it . howev if place in an alreadi warm outsid temperatur the insid could in fact overheat . so a dark grai doghous would be prefer ina cooler environ .
26917	10	1	1	light grai the doghous would not be hot but it would not be too cold either .
26918	10	1	1	dark grai you want the doghous to be hot but not too hot so dark grei is right in the middl
26919	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai should keep the doghous a medium temperatur that isnt too hot or to cold .
26920	10	1	1	light grai light grai would keep the doghous warm so the dog wont be cold but also at a reason temperatur so that the dog wont be to hot .
26921	10	1	2	black black absorb more heat energi so the insid of the doghous will stai warm if it ha alight sourc the sun . thi is proven when thei had a black lid on the jar and it gain 53 deg with the light sourc be the heat sourc .
26922	10	1	1	white the color affect the temperatur of insid the doghous becaus darker color attract more heat than white . i chose white becaus it ha the lowest averag temperatur of 42 deg c . the averag of black wa 53 . 25 deg c dark grai 48 deg c light grai 45 deg c and white 42 deg c . all of thi data wa from the experi . the differ is 11 . 25 deg c from lowest averag to highest averag .
26923	10	1	1	white if you paint it white it will attract less heat from the sun and the dog will like it . . . . .
26924	10	1	0	black the color will affect how warm or cold the dog hous is . becaus the white would be 42 deg and black would be 53 deg .
26925	10	0	0	light grai light grai wont affect the doghous in anywai .
26926	10	0	0	white i choos white becaus if it get hot in the summer than the dog can overheat becaus thei onli swept on there nose and paw
26927	10	0	0	light grai light grai hold the same temperatur of 48 deg everi time
26928	10	0	0	white my dog like white
26929	10	2	2	light grai light grai will keep the insid of the doghous cool but not to cold and will keep it at a medium temperatur for the dog . the data show that the light grai jar averag temperatur wa 45 deg c while the black jar wa 53 deg c and the white jar is 42 deg c . so the grai i think is the most comfort temperatur for the dog .
26930	10	2	2	white becaus it had lowest temp after 10 minut which is 42 deg c
26931	10	2	2	white the color white is the color that got the lowest air temperatur on the lid color vs air temperatur insid glass jar so it would keep the doghous the coolest insid so the dog would be most comfort .
26932	10	2	2	white the best paint color for the doghous is white . thi is becaus the color of white reflect heat while the color of black absorb heat . the dog wouldnt want a hot sweati doghous . after 10 minut of heat from the lamp the insid air in the black color jar had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . but the white color jar had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c . the white color doghous is the best color for cool instead of hot moist and sweati .
26933	10	1	0	dark grai thi color would deflect heat but also keep the insid warm .
26934	10	1	0	light grai it well keep it from get to hot
26935	10	1	1	white white is the color most like perform becaus the color white doesnt absorb the sun radiat so it doesnt heat up as hot as other would .
26936	10	1	1	white paint the doghous white will make the doghous absorb less heat and the insid will stai cooler then if it were paint a darker color
26937	10	2	2	black the color black might affect the doghous by make it warmer than us a lighter color like white becaus black had an averag temp of 53 degre and the color white had an averag temperatur of 42 degre . make the temperatur 11 degre warmer .
26938	10	2	2	white if the doghous wa paint white it would not get as hot on the insid on warm dai . the averag lowest temperatur after 10 minut alight wa 42 deg with the white lid .
26939	10	0	0	dark grai darker color absorb more energi .
26940	10	1	1	dark grai the doghous would be warm becaus dark grai is in the middl of the temperatur rang when expos to light and heat .
26941	10	1	1	white it ll make the doghous a lot more cooler be case the lighter the color the less heat is attract to it by the sun .
26942	10	1	1	white in the summer when it realli hot the white color will attract less heat therefor leav the doghous cooler .
26943	10	2	2	white i would choos white becaus the temperatur is cooler the averag come ina 42 deg c and the other on ar hotter like light grai is 45 deg c and dark grai is 48 deg and black at 53 deg . so i would have choos the coolest least hottest on so the dog would not get hot
26944	10	1	1	white us white as the color for the doghous roof would be best becaus the sunlight isnt attract to weight as it is black . so the dog will stai cool and not hot insid hi hous .
26945	10	2	2	white the color white will affect the doghous ina good wai . the color white down t absorb as much heat as the other color do . when thei did the experi the color white onli got to 42 deg c while the color black got to 53 deg c . also white turn out to beth color that absorb the least heat of onli 42 deg c . which mean insid the doghous it will stai nice and cool becaus it doe t absorb as much heat as the other color do .
26946	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus in the summer it will not ge too hot and in the winter it will not get that cold .
26947	10	0	0	white becaus the doghous wont get too warm and dog have fur on them therefor thei would not want there doghous to get to warm .
26948	10	2	1	white white becaus the white lid temperatur onli went up to 42 deg c . the other lid color got a higher temperatur so i chose the on that had the least temperatur .
26949	10	1	1	dark grai it would make it cooler in the summer and warm in the winter
26950	10	1	1	black it could make it to warm for the dog it depend on the weather .
26951	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai would probabl be best for the doghous becaus it absorb heat but it still leav out heat so when it is hot out the doghous wont absorb to much heat .
26952	10	1	1	dark grai i think that dark grai would beth best color to have on a dog hose becaus the dark grai had a steadi featur on it that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot dure the dai .
26953	10	2	2	white white would beth best color choic becaus in the experi white wa the coolest color of an averag of 42 deg c .
26954	10	2	2	white the lighter the color the cooler the dog hous will be caus it to be more comfort . the white lid wa an averag of 42 deg c 3 deg c color than the other lid
26955	10	1	1	light grai the color of the doghous would keep it the right temperatur not to cold and not to warm .
26956	10	1	1	white becaus from there experi the white lid didnt get that much deathlik the other
26957	10	1	1	white the color will affect the doghous becaus it will keep the doghous colder . by paint the doghous white the air temperatur insid the doghous will stai lower . sinc white is alight color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker color will .
26958	10	2	2	black paint the doghous black would caus the temperatur to increas the most . in the experi the averag air temperatur in the glass with the black lid wa 53 deg c the glass with the dark grai lid wa 48 deg c the glass with the light grai lid wa 45 deg c and the glass with the white lid wa 42 deg c . thi prove that if brandi and jerri want their doghous to be warm thei should us black paint . otherwis thei should us white paint if thei want a cooler doghous .
26959	10	1	1	black the black color would make the doghous warmer for the winter so that the dog will stai warm .
26960	10	2	1	dark grai it is the second highest and it should keep the doghous worm without get to hot
26961	10	0	1	dark grai my opinion for light grai caus it seem like an ava era temperatur out of the four color so i thing that the dog wont get hot if the color method work
26962	10	1	1	white becaus white doesnt attract as much heat and therefor the dog would be a lot cooler ina white doghous than a black on for exampl .
26963	10	1	1	white the color white will make it cooler in the dog hous so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it ha .
26964	10	2	2	white white would beth smarter choic becaus it reflect heat vers absorb it . accord to the data the jar with the white lid stai the coolest insid . have black roof tile would be smart as well becaus dure the dai thei would absorb heat and then at night when it cool down the doghous is warm insid . togeth these two color would make averi comfort hous .
26965	10	2	2	white i chose the color white for the doghous . thi is becaus if the darker the color the greater increas in temperatur then i would want to choos the lightest color so that the temperatur of the insid of the doghous would be cooler than the color light grai dark grai and black . thi would help the dog stai cooler and not get as hot in the summer . the darker the color the greater increas in temperatur is correct becaus the averag temperatur of the insid of the jar with the black lid wa 53 deg c when the averag temperatur of the insid of the jar with the white lid wa 42 deg c . the white lid jar wa 11 deg cooler than the black lid jar .
26966	10	1	1	black that color might affect the doghous becaus it will be realli dark . and the temperatur will be realli high .
26967	10	2	2	dark grai i chose thi color for the doghous becaus sinc the doghous will be locat outsid you dont want the dog to be cold at night all dog do in the doghous is sleep anywai . the experi with differ color of lid prove it did have an effect on the air temperatur insid the jar . the darker the lid the higher the temperatur becaus darker color absorb more heat . which is why i chose dark grai for the doghous . so it not too warm for the dog but if the dog get hot it can alwai come outsid of the doghous and sleep .
26968	10	0	1	dark grai dark grei becaus the darker the color the hotter it get and so if you us light grai it best becaus white is to cold black is to hot and light grei could be to cold also .
26969	10	0	0	black it wont be as hot
26970	10	0	0	light grai it can effect the rai of the sun
26971	10	0	0	black i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
26972	10	1	1	white you would probabl want to choos white begun se that is the color that will keep it the coolest insid the doghous when the sun is shin it is usual warm outsid and the dog will want to us it to cool off not to get even more hot .
26973	10	2	2	white the color might affect the doghous by keep it cool . in the experi white had the averag of 42 deg c as for black had an averag of 53 deg c . therefor 42 white is less than 53 black so brandi and jerri should paint the doghous white .
26974	10	1	1	white the doghous will be cooler and more com after be for the dog if it is white .
26975	10	0	0	black black absorb all color and the data tabl show that the averag for black paint is 53 degre
26976	10	2	2	white white wa the lid color with the coolest temperatur after 10 minut paint the doghous white will keep the insid of the doghous cooler becaus white will reflect more of the sun heat than sai black paint . in other word the darker the color the more heat it absorb and transfer to the insid of the doghous . we want to keep the doghous as cool as possibl so that the dog doesnt overheat .
26977	10	1	1	white the color might effect the doghous by make it the temperatur lower .
26978	10	2	2	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus it will keep warm in side but also it will keep cool when need so if it hot outsid it will be warm but not to hot and if it cold outsid it will be cool but also warm as well . i know thi becaus with the dark grai averag temperatur wa 48 deg c which wa a greet good median consid the black averag wa 53 deg c and the white averag wa 42 deg c .
26979	10	2	2	white the color white would keep the doghous not as hot insid as the other color becaus white had the lowest temperatur in the experi . whit had the lowest temperatur averag which wa 42 deg c . light grai averag wa 45 deg c . dark grai averag wa 48 deg c . black averag wa 53 deg c . that show us that white had the lowest temperatur and will keep the doghous not as hot .
26980	10	2	2	light grai brandi and jerri should paint the doghous light grai . if the doghous is paint in light grai the temperatur insid the doghous would not be too hot or too cold . in the result show that the air temperatur with light grai lid is 45 deg c with white it 42 deg c and with dark grai it 48 deg c . temperatur with light grai is warmer than white lid but it not too hot like the dark grai on .
26981	10	2	1	white thi color would beth best to pick to paint the doghous becaus white reflect the sun energi and dose not labor sob it like all the dark color . . . see if you look on the data tabl it show that the larg temperatur for each color wa black 53 dark grai 48 light grai 45 white 42 as shown on the averag of the differ color it show that white doesnt overs that much of the sun energi and t hat why i think white should be what thei choos .
26982	10	1	1	black it is warmer than other color
26983	10	1	1	white white becaus black would absorb a lot of the sun thermal energi witch would overheat and dehydr the dog same with dark grai and light grai white would beth best choic becaus white reflect light as oppos to absorb it make the inner temperatur cooler and more comfort for the dog .
26984	10	1	1	light grai i choos light grai becaus it is not to cold and not to hot just right . if i choos a darker color it might get to hot for the dog and if it is a realli light color it will be to cold and wont keep him warm .
26985	10	2	2	white the color white is the best choic . it will keep the doghous a cooler textur . thi is proven by the data gather by the trial . accord to the data the averag air temperatur of a black lid on ajar wa 53 deg c . when the lid wa chang the white the temperatur drop to an averag of 42 deg c . thi prove that white would be abett temperatur control factor .
26986	10	2	2	black black would effect the doghous becaus it a darker color and darker color absorb heat which would make the dog hous warmer insid . in the experi when brandi and jerri put the black lid on the jar the averag temperatur wa deg c oppos to when thei put thee white lid on the averag temperatur wa onli 42 deg . in the end black would effect the doghous by make it much warmer insid the doghous .
26987	10	1	1	light grai light grai will make the insid of the doghous warm but not too hot so in the winter a dog wont be cold but in summer it wont be too hot either . 45 deg c is a good warm temperatur and the temperatur insid the doghous should remain that temperatur unless the color is chang .
26988	10	1	1	light grai it wont get as much heat as black becaus dark color absorb more heat then other color .
26989	10	1	1	light grai light grai will keep the temperatur of the dog hous not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter . if the dog hous wa white it would have a temperatur averag of 42 deg c and if the doghous wa black it would have an averag temperatur of 53 deg c and the dark grai would be to warm as well at 48 deg c
26990	10	1	2	white paint the doghous white would be veri smart if you didnt want your pet to overheat on those dread hot summer dai . base on brandi and jerri s experi the color black give off more 11 deg c oppos to the color white .
26991	10	1	1	white that color white will effect the heat becaus the light the color the less heat it will attract and so then the white will give off less heat and the dog will stai cool .
26992	10	2	2	black black paint would warm the insid of the doghous more than the other color . in the experi black heat up an averag of 53 deg c while the other color were never increas more than 48 deg c . if it wa cold outsid that color would warm the doghous more becaus of the low albert and high absorpt of energi .
26993	10	0	0	light grai brandi and jerri should paint the doghous a dark grai becaus you dont want a lot of energi in you doghous it should becalm and relax but you alwai want some energi . the dark grai will make he dog feel more relax becaus in the experi it sai that the darker color absorb more energi than the lighter color .
26994	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai color would absorb more heat than a white or light grai color keep the dog warmer when the temperatur is colder . but when the temperatur is warmer outsid it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would keep the dog cooler .
26995	10	2	2	white thi color would keep the doghous colder than the other color becaus from the record data black averag temperatur wa 53 degre calcium when white wa onli 42 degre cell is
26996	10	1	1	white white becaus it will make it a lot more cool temperatur wise than if it were black becaus darker color absorb a lot more heat
26997	10	0	0	white will thei would like the dog to stai warm in hi doghous and white doesnt allow that much air to come in
26998	10	1	1	white i would choos white becaus it attract less heat to the doghous .
26999	10	0	0	black it will effect it becaus the sun rai will heat it
27000	10	1	1	black it will make it veri hot in the doghous
27001	10	1	2	dark grai i choos dark grai becaus it not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white . it a perfect temperatur for the dog in my opinion . it doesnt have to much heat but just right it a relax amount of heat .
27002	10	1	1	white thei should paint the doghous white becaus if thei would of paint i black it would attract more heat into the hous and white doe not attract heat or the sunlight .
27003	10	1	1	white thi might affect the insid of the doghous becaus darker color absorb more energi from the sun white would bring a minimum amount of heat .
27004	10	2	2	black if you paint the doghous black the dog hous would be a littl bit warmer in the winter the onli bad part is that in the summer it will be a littl hot insid the doghous . i know thi becaus in the experi that brandi and jerri did it said that the jar with the black lid wa the hottest .
27005	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai would be a good color fora dog hous becaus it will keep the doghous warm dure the winter and dure the summer the dog will spend most of it time outsid it hous . the result in the experi were 48 deg c solid so that is a good temperatur fora doghous . not too hot and not too cold .
27006	10	2	2	black if thei would like the dog to stai warmer thei should chose black becaus on averag the black lid had a higher temp natur than the white lid .
27007	10	0	0	light grai i choos light grai becaus it would be a nice temperatur . if the doghous wa pant black the temperatur would averag 53 deg c . if it wa dark grai the temperatur would averag 48 deg c . if the dog hous wa paint white then the temperatur would averag 42 deg c . but alight grai color would make the averag temperatur a nice comfort 45 deg c .
27008	10	0	0	light grai it well make it lighter so the dog can see more better .
27009	10	2	2	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus thi will result in the doghous be warm but not realli hot . it realli depend on where the peopl live and on the season . dark grai 48 deg c would be more suitabl becaus it would be pretti hot dure summer but not as hot as the black 53 deg c but it also would be warm dure the winter so it a compromis between the weather . the temperatur us for explan wa the averag .
27010	10	2	1	light grai i think that light grai would beth best color becaus it absorb enough light to make the dog warm without get it too hot . black would make it too hot and white would make it too cold .
27011	10	2	2	black if you paint the doghous black the insid would be hot . becaus accord to the experi the color black would make thing hot . the averag for the temperatur wa 53 deg c for black . the averag for dark grai wa 48 deg c and grai wa 45 deg c . also white wa 42 deg c . accord to thi data black would make thing hot .
27012	10	2	2	white have thi color will effect the doghous becaus light color reflect heat so if you paint the hous white then there wont as much heat on the wall make the doghous cooler . thi is shown by the fact that in the jar experi black had the hottest data and white had the coolest .
27013	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it will not be to hot or c old
27014	10	1	1	white if thei us white the doghous would be colder insid then it would if the doghous wa black . the reason why it would be colder is becaus white reflect more sunlight than the color black . darker color usual absurd more heat then lighter color .
27015	10	1	1	white the darker the color the greatest increas in temperatur becaus darker color absorb more energi . the white would keep the doghous roof cool on averi sunni dai sinc the light color doesnt absorb energi as fast as the dark color .
27016	10	2	2	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus it would effect the doghous by not make the insid of it to hot or to cold . the averag of the four averag wa 47 deg c so i chose the closest on to 47 deg c and dark grai wa 48 deg c so that why i chose dark grai .
27017	10	0	0	black the black kid bring in the hot air and hold it . good conductor
27018	10	2	1	white white becaus in the data it sai that white had the lowest temperatur with a averag of 42 deg c . if the thei paint it white it would keep the doghous at a cooler temperatur dure hot sunni dai .
27019	10	1	1	white white becaus black color dark color attract ek heat toward them so if you get light color white the te departur would be cooler in there .
27020	10	1	1	white the tempi her will still rise but less then the other on
27021	10	1	1	white thi might affect the doghous becaus it will keep the doghous cool insid dure the summer .
27022	10	1	1	white white had the lowest averag temperatur so it would be more relax for the dog .
27023	10	2	2	black black would beth best color to paint the doghous . on wai we know that is when we did the experi with the lid color black end up with an averag temperatur of 53 degre calcium while white end up with 42 degre calcium . thi prove that black absorb the most heat . if we paint the doghous black it will absorb much more heat than sai a white doghous .
27024	10	0	0	white white down t absorb light howev black dose
27025	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai will affect the doghous by make it warm in the doghous . not to cold like white or light grai and not too hot like the black .
27026	10	1	1	black the darker the color that more heat it absorb from the sun which would make the doghous much warmer . thei said becaus darker color absorb more energi . .
27027	10	1	1	black black might affect the insid of the dog hous becaus it will get realli hot in the insid caus the sun will produc more heat on the darker color than the lighter color .
27028	10	1	1	light grai it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be toot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27029	10	1	1	white i would sai that paint the doghous white would beth best option becaus white absorb the heat amount of heat energi and sinc doghous ar alreadi small thei ar alreadi hot and you dont want the dog to get overh plu dog have lot of fur to keep them even warmer . if there is a chilli dai in the winter you can put a blanket insid to keep the dog warm but i would sai that altogeth white is the best choic .
27030	10	1	1	light grai the color brandi amp jerri should choos should be light grei becaus if it wa too dark then the hous would get to hot but if it wa too light it would be more cooler then the black but it would be veri dirti .
27031	10	1	1	white if thei choos white then the increas in temperatur will beth lowest of all the color .
27032	10	0	1	dark grai the dark grai color would keep the doghous pretti cool dure the summer but also wouldnt be too cold dure the winter becaus the temperatur wa the same the whole time .
27033	10	0	0	black black becaus it attract sun and make the dog hous have more heat
27034	10	1	1	white if thei paint the doghous black or ani dark color the doghous would be wai to hot for the dog becaus the dark color absorb more heat then light color .
27035	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai would probabl beth best color becaus it not black and it not white in the winter it can get realli cold and white attract less heat but in the summer it might be okai but black in the summer might be to much heat soto even thing out i think dark grai is okai .
27036	10	1	1	black becaus the paint chang color the hotter it get
27037	10	0	0	white i sai white becaus the doghous is alreadi go to be semi warm insid without the paint . and with the white paint the doghous is alreadi like 40 deg . so the sun shine on the dog hous that would put the doghous at 80 deg insid dure the dai . then at night the doghous will be in the pu somewher
27038	10	2	2	black the black paint will make the doghous warmer for the dog becaus the black lid on the jar absorb the most heat with the highest averag temperatur 53 deg c .
27039	10	2	2	black i think black would beth best paint color becaus it will make the doghous warmer when the sun is shine down on the doghous . the averag temperatur for the color black wa 53 degre while the white color wa onli 42 degre . therefor black is the better color to paint the doghous .
27040	10	1	1	light grai if the color wa darker but not black it would keep the doghous warmer but not make it to hot becaus like in the experi it wa warm but not hot
27041	10	1	1	light grai i chose light grai becaus the insid of the doghous would be warm and the dog fur would keep the dog warm in the winter .
27042	10	2	2	white the white will affect the temperatur insid the doghous by make it cooler . the white absorb less heat so it keep more out of the doghous allow the dog to be more com four abl .
27043	10	0	0	dark grai alpha why ar all of these question so free ken hard alpha
27044	10	1	1	white it will help keep the dog hose cool beau white attack the least amount of heat
27045	10	2	2	black the color might affect the doghous becaus brandi and jerri said that darker color absorb more energi heat so a darker color will make sure the dog is warm .
27046	10	0	0	black the darker color absorb more energi
27047	10	1	1	dark grai dark grei becaus it not too dark so that the dog get to hot in the summertim but it not like it reflect the heat in the winter so the dog and stai warm . the averag temp wa 48 deg c so it wa about the middl of the not to hot and not too cold .
27048	10	2	2	dark grai i would us dark grai . the darker color would keep the doghous warmer . black had an averag of 53 deg wherea white had onli 42 deg . howev we must rememb that a dog is a live thing and cannot overheat . dark grai had an averag of 48 deg . thi is enough to keep the dog warm without overhear said creatur . so in conclus i ve determin that dark grai is the most logic choic .
27049	10	2	2	white i chose white becaus white would keep the doghous the coolest temperatur . when thei did the experi the black wa the hottest 53 deg c the dark grai wa in the middl 48 deg c the light grai wa also in the middl 45 deg c and the white wa the c coolest 42 deg c .
27050	10	1	0	light grai light grai becaus it not to light and it not to dark
27051	10	2	2	white it wa the coolest with the temp . of 42 deg c . it would be to hot to us black which wa 53 deg c . insid the jar .
27052	10	1	1	white the color whit will keep the doghous color becaus the color whit deflect light better make the doghous cooler .
27053	10	1	1	light grai it would not make the doghous too hot or too cold for the dog .
27054	10	1	1	white the lid color white could make a differ between the black lid . the temperatur could not be high so thei must keep the temp futur cool for the dog .
27055	10	1	1	white it would make the temperatur insid the doghous not as hot so the dog doe not overheat
27056	10	1	1	white the color white might effect the doghous becaus it absorb less sunlight then black dark grei or light grei . what thi would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the doghous
27057	10	2	2	black i chose the black color becaus that if the dog like it hot then thi would beth right becaus when thei see what c color would beth hottest and the trial number ar 54 deg 52 deg 53 deg deg c and the averag temp . is 53 deg c if the dog like it hot in there
27058	10	2	2	white darker color usual attract more light . by attract more light it usual make thing much warmer . so if you have the lightest color there is then it would attract less light and make the doghous cooler . accord to the data us a black lid made the jar about 53 degre the dark grai made it about 48 degre the light grai made it 45 degre and the white wa about 42 degre . as you can seeth lightest color had the lowest temperatur . so by us the lightest color it would attract less heat so thei should us the white paint .
27059	10	1	1	black a dark color like black will affect the insid of the doghous becaus the darker the color the greater the increas in air temperatur becaus darker color absorb more energi .
27060	10	1	2	white i would choos white on reason why is becaus u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark color and in your experi white came the color that didnt get as much heat as other did .
27061	10	1	1	white the white color doe not absorb as much energi as black . in the doghous the temperatur will be about 42 deg c when it is a sunni dai .
27062	10	1	1	dark grai first where ever you live if it alwai warm i would paint it light color . but if the area you live in is alwai c old i would paint it a dark color . my theori is your dog is go to stai warm if the weather is alwai warm . your dog will be warm dure the dai or night when your doghous is a dark color . the dark color is go to attract the energi .
27063	10	1	0	black if the weather where brandi and jerri live is cold if thei paint the doghous black it would absorb more heat than dark grei light grei and white .
27064	10	1	1	light grai light grei would be good becaus it wouldnt get hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it realli hot insid the doghous .
27065	10	2	2	black if thei paint the doghous black their dog will alwai stai warm becaus the color black will give the most heat . i know thi becaus the averag temperatur in their experi wa 53 deg c and the other were in the low forti s .
27066	10	1	1	white thi color might make the interior of the hous cooler .
27067	10	1	1	white thi color will be best becaus when it hot outsid the doghous will be cooler than if thei paint it black ora darker color .
27068	10	1	1	black black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the doghous a hot temperatur .
27069	10	0	0	black deg
27070	10	1	1	dark grai i think he should us the dark grai color to paint hi hous becaus it will be kinda in the middl of the other them featur . if thei paint it white in the winter it might be colder becaus it doe t attract to much heat . if thei pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer becaus it attract more heat . light grai will kinda be like if you paint it white . so i think you should paint it dark grai so that in summer it attack some heat . and that in the winter it doe too . so it would be even out in both summer and winter .
27071	10	1	1	white white wont effect the doghous becaus white doesnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be abl to us the doghous
27072	10	1	1	dark grai if the doghous wa paint black the dog would get too hot in the summertim becaus the color black absorb more energi . but if the doghous wa paint white the dog would be easili c old in the wintertim becaus the color whit absorb less energi . in conclus paint the doghous dark grai will attract the right amount of energi for the dog .
27073	10	1	1	white becaus white reflect off the sun so it would keep the dog cooler instead of have a black roof that absorb light and would keep the dog veri hot .
27074	10	2	2	black i believ that the doghous should be paint black becaus it can keep the doghous warm dure the winter . the data show that the insid of the glass jar wa 53 deg c when the black lid wa us . us the black lid prove to have the highest temperatur in the glass jar . a disadvantag would be that in the summer the doghous will be too hot but as for the winter the black is the correct choic .
27075	10	2	2	white the lighter the color the lower the temperatur . the averag temperatur of the black lid after just 10 minut wa 53 deg the averag temperatur for the dark grai lid after 10 minut wa 48 deg the averag temperatur for the light grai lid after 10 minut wa 45 deg and the averag temperatur for the white lid after just 10 minut wa 42 deg . therefor alight grai and white paint would be best to keep the doghous cool becaus it heat up slower then the other color . but if you were to us black or dark grai it would keep the doghous warmer .
27076	10	2	2	white the color of the doghous should be white becaus if you choos darker color then the doghous will get too hot and your dog will be hot swell . as the studi shown the color black had an averag of heat up to 53 degre calcium and had a differ of 11 degre delici than white color did . same as the color black dark grai will also be too hot if thei paint the doghous dark grai becaus the color dark grai had an averag of 48 degre delici and wa 6 degre hotter than white . also in the studi the color light grai got an averag of 45 degre delici and had a differ of 3 degre delici hotter than the color white . the best color that brandi and jerri should paint for their doghous would have to beth color white becaus the color white had a cooler temperatur than all the rest of the color becaus in the experi thei made the averag degre in delici for white wa 42 degre delici and if thei paint their doghous thi color the doghous wouldnt get hot nor your dog .
27077	10	1	1	white thi might affect th doghous by make it c color in there instead of realli hot all the time .
27078	10	2	2	black black paint color would caus the insid of the doghous to be warmer than the rest of the color . thi is becaus black absorb the most amount of f color over everi other color . to prove thi in brandi and jerri s experi black kept the temperatur of the jar warmer than all the rest . it wa 6 deg c warmer than grai 10 deg c warmer than light grai and 12 deg warmer than white . thi clearli show that black would keep the doghous warm .
27079	10	1	0	dark grai dure the winter brandi and jerri s dog will stai nice and warm but not to warm when summer come .
27080	10	0	0	white it could get dirti you could giant it over asia and you could draw on the wall .
27081	10	1	1	black the dark paint color is better becaus the greater the increas in air temperatur in the doghous becaus darker color absorb more energi .
27082	10	2	1	white if brandi and jerri us the color white fort he doghous the dog will not overheat becaus the color white doe not attract the heat as much as the darker color so the doghous would be much cooler .
27083	10	0	0	black cut black is ugli just like robert pattern
27084	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous at a lower temp true becaus in the tabl it averag 42 deg . and black avert 53 . 25 deg soto have a cooler doghous paint it white .
27085	10	2	2	white while us white for the doghous the dog hous would be a lot cooler then the other color becaus the data show that the color white did not get as hot as the other color did . that wai the dog would not be so hot in it hous .
27086	10	2	2	black black becaus in the experi black wa the on that had the highest temperatur so the darker the color wa the higher the featur wa .
27087	10	1	1	dark grai i would choos dark grai becaus it doesnt attract a ton of light . which mean the dog wont get to hot . but also becaus it doe attract some light which allow it stai warm .
27088	10	1	1	black the color black would affect the doghous by keep it warmest becaus dark color absorb light and turn it into heat .
27089	10	1	1	white white is the best color for the doghous becaus it absorb less energi then black paint would . and then the doghous wouldnt be too hot for the dog .
27090	10	2	2	white have the doghous paint white will affect the doghous by make it absorb less heat caus the doghous to be cool insid dure the summer . becaus in the experi the black lid averag temperatur wa 53 deg and the white lid averag temperatur wa 42 deg that s a 11 deg differ . so paint the doghous white would beth best decis of paint .
27091	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it wont be too hot dure the summer also wont be to cold in the winter .
27092	10	1	1	white it wont be so hot insid and it will stai cool
27093	10	1	1	dark grai thi will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold .
27094	10	1	1	dark grai i pick dark grai becaus it stai the same temperatur and in the data tabl it stai the same temperatur .
27095	10	1	1	white becaus if the dog us it in the summer it will be cooler then a black doghous
27096	10	0	0	white it all about all the color ha that sick i could type now so how u bin good me im good to a peac
27097	10	0	0	black black would be a good color becaus dark color absorb more energi and it would be more comfort .
27098	10	0	0	dark grai i think it would be a good color for the doghous
27099	10	1	1	white white will effect the doghous . first thi will effect it becaus white will make it cooler in the summer becaus white doesnt absorb veri much heat .
27100	10	2	2	black black absorb light . just like with the jar lid when it wa black it absorb the most . so if you color the doghous black it would increas the temperatur insid it .
27101	10	2	2	black thei should paint the doghous black becaus black will help keep the dog warm at night and dure the winter when it get cold . when thei us the black lid it made it warm at an averag of 5 3 deg c compar to when thei us a white lid that onli made it warm at an averag of 42 deg c . that a differ of 11 deg c .
27102	10	1	1	white becaus light color ar the coolest in the summertim so with white be the lightest on white would work best .
27103	10	1	1	white it will make it be cooler in the doghous
27104	10	2	2	white the color white for the color of the doghous would keep the doghous nice and cool as shown in the tabl from the scenario when the glass jar with the white lid had an averag temperatur of 42 deg compar to the glass jar with the black lid averag temperatur of 53 deg .
27105	10	1	1	light grai light grai caus thi will give the doghous some dark but also bright so the dog will be abl to stai cool and can sleep .
27106	10	1	1	white i chose white becaus it wa the color that absorb less heat
27107	10	1	1	black if brandi and jerri paint the doghous black then the doghous would be warmer becaus the darker the color is the energi the doghous can absorb .
27108	10	0	1	dark grai it might make the doghous warmer dure winter month . for exampl the averag heat for the dark grei paint wa 48 deg c
27109	10	2	2	black sinc black is the darkest color of all the other color dark grai light grai and white becaus of the theori that darker color absorb more energi heat the insid of the doghous will be warmer as of the doghous be paint the other color . the proof that black would beth best paint color for the doghous is becaus black is the darkest of all the other color and darker color absorb more energi also if you look at the data tabl for the lid color vs . air temperatur insid glass jar experi the averag temperatur for all 4 color wa black be the highest with 53 deg c dark grai be 48 deg c light grai be 45 deg c and white be 42 deg c . therefor black would beth best paint color for the doghous .
27110	10	0	0	white it observ less energi from the sun than all the darker color
27111	10	1	1	light grai the insid wont be too hot nor too cold
27112	10	0	0	white it will make the area temp her go down by 11 degre
27113	10	0	0	dark grai i think dark grei would beth best on becaus it stai at the same temperatur everi trial . also it would beth best on becaus it affect the doghous as much as the other becaus it stai at the same constant temperatur of 48 deg c so that color on the doghous would be reliabl .
27114	10	0	0	black the black paint color would help make the doghous warmer dure winter and isol it better . in the experi the black lid had the best isol becaus it start at 24 deg c and end at 53 deg c on averag . it wa by far the best lid .
27115	10	0	0	black the color my affect the doghous becaus the dog might not beth same color as the hous or the hous will be to dark becaus it black .
27116	10	1	1	black paint the doghous black darker color absorb more light would attract more thermal energi make the doghous nice and warm for those raini washington night .
27117	10	1	1	white white becaus it doesnt absorb light it reflect it so their for the insid of the doghous is not go to hot . but if you us black the insid of the doghous is go to be veri hot becaus black absorb light .
27118	10	1	1	dark grai it would keep it warm in the doghous
27119	10	0	0	white black and grai absorb the color
27120	10	1	1	black if brandi and jerri pick paint their dog hous black then the dog will get veri hot in the doghous becaus black absorb the most energi . as a result paint the doghous black with attract the sun and make the dog miser .
27121	10	2	2	light grai light grai would be best so that it keep the insid warm but not too hot . in the lamp experi it wa the end coolest color .
27122	10	0	0	black the color will affect the doghous becaus it will be less hot in the doghous and black reflect sunlight .
27123	10	2	2	white thi color will make the air in the doghous less hot so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghous . i know thi becaus in the experi the air is hottest with a black lid and coolest with a white on . so if the sun is beat down on the doghous it will onli reach about 42 deg c instead of 45 deg c or higher .
27124	10	1	1	white color will affect the doghous becaus if the hous is paint black it will get veri hot insid but if it is white it will sai cool allow for the dog to be comfort insid
27125	10	2	2	white the shade white will make the doghous cooler insid becaus the shade white doe not absorb as much light energi as the shade black . i know thi becaus in brandi and jerri s experi the air temperatur insid the jar with the black lid wa an averag of 53 deg c and the averag temperatur of the jar with the white lid wa 42 deg c . but id like to point out that black and white arent color theyr shade . get it right .
27126	10	1	1	white the color white would best suit the doghous becaus the color white doe not attract veri much heat energi so that wai the insid of the doghous will not be overh .
27127	10	0	0	white white affect the doghous temperatur becaus it ha less heat absorb in it .
27128	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grai with make the hous be warm not to color to hot . the data show that the dark grai is alwai 48 deg c so you dont have to worri about the temperatur get older ar hotter .
27129	10	0	0	white if you paint the entir doghous white then it will appear to be lighter insid .
27130	10	1	0	white it will make it for insid of the doghous it wont ne so hot becaus thi is the color that reflect light .
27131	10	1	1	white white will cool down the doghous becaus it is a lighter color .
27132	10	2	2	white it will affect it by make it cooler than what the black would be if it were to be directli hit by the sun . the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c and the white lid had an averag of 42 deg c therefor the white lid will keep their dog cooler in the sun .
27133	10	2	2	white i believ that if brandi and jerri pain the doghous white it would stai the coldest for the dog . evid show that the darker the color the more hot it get for exampl the averag temperatur for black is 53 deg the averag temperatur for dark grai is 48 deg the averag temperatur for light grai is 45 deg . the white color of lid wa the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperatur 42 deg . i suggest paint the doghous white .
27134	10	2	2	white the color white would affect the doghous in mani good wai . on wai is it wouldnt be so hot in the doghous and the dog would enjoi be in it . the data tabl show the temperatur through a three wai trial . the averag temperatur is 42 deg c which is a lot cooler and fresh then the color temperatur .
27135	10	0	0	dark grai it will stai the same even after it dry .
27136	10	1	1	black it will make the insid of the doghous warmer for the dog becaus dark color absorb more heat then light color as shown in the investig .
27137	10	1	2	white it would be best to paint the doghous white becaus it wont make the doghous as hot when the sun come out . white wont attract as much heat insid the doghous as we discov in the experi white had the lowest temperatur becaus it is a lighter color . as the color got darker the temperatur got hotter .
27138	10	1	1	white the lightest color attract less heat .
27139	10	1	1	light grai it would keep the doghous cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27140	10	0	0	white i think that the white will affect the dog hous becaus the sun will shine in and melt it
27141	10	2	2	black i would choos black for my dog hous brno us dure the winter the doghous would need all the heat it could get so i would choos black . black is the best color to choos becaus in the test it wa an averag of 11 deg c hotter
27142	10	0	0	white white doesnt absorb much energi compar to black . black absorb the energi like crazi
27143	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it wouldnt make it to hot in the doghous sour dog could sleep com fur abl
27144	10	2	2	black i chose the paint color black becaus thi color would caus the doghous to be warm all the time . even on a cloudi or raini dai brandi and jerri s doghous would be warm insid becaus the black paint would absorb the sunlight that wa still radiat from the sun . after 10 minut of heat the glass jar with the black lid the air averag temperatur rais 29 deg c from the start temperatur of 24 deg c to result in an averag air temperatur after 10 minut of 5 3 deg c . the glass jar with the white lid averag air temperatur rais onli 18 deg c from the start temperatur of 24 deg c to result in an averag air temperatur after 10 minut of 42 deg c . the differ between the two averag temperatur for the glass jar with the black lid and the glass jar with the white lid wa 10 deg c . thi mean that the darker the color on an object the more heat energi the color absorb caus the air temperatur within the object to be highest compar to ani color lighter than it . therefor brandi and jerri should paint their doghous black due to the high amount of thermal energi that the color absorb .
27145	10	1	2	black becaus the temperatur will be high and not low . paint it black is the highest temperatur
27146	10	1	1	white i chose white becaus white would keep the doghous cool in the summer .
27147	10	2	2	white the white had the lowest temp . in the jar so if you paint the doghous white then it wouldnt be as warm .
27148	10	1	0	white white dun not tat so mush heat
27149	10	2	1	white white would make the doghous the least temperatur . the data show that the temperatur wa on averag 42 deg c . the doghous would be a cool environ instead of too hot . the doghous would be a place for the dog togo when he is too hot .
27150	10	1	1	white white will make the doghous cooler so it more comfort in hot weather .
27151	10	0	0	light grai it will affect it becaus it will absorb less heat

27153	10	1	1	white white will not absorb so much heat than the other .
27154	10	1	1	light grai the color light grei is best for the dog hous becaus it doe not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not overheat but it will not freez .
27155	10	1	0	white the color white absorb the least amount of energi so by color the doghous white it will ensur the doghous is a more comfort temperatur for the dog .
27156	10	1	2	dark grai dark grai would be a good color for the doghous so that the dog doesnt overheat or get too cold . the hous would stai cool in the summer and warm in the winter . dark grai had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c while black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c and white had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c .
27157	10	2	2	black if you choos a black color for your dog hous the temperatur would be warmer than if you us a white color becaus the air insid the jar with the black lid wa warmer than the lighter color
27158	10	1	1	light grai it will keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter .
27159	10	2	2	white the lighter the color the less air temperatur . the white lid color ha an averag of 42 deg c . the black lid color ha an averag of 53 deg c . the white lid color ha 11 deg c less heat energi than the black lid color . therefor if brandi and jerri ar design a doghous for the summer then thei should us the color white sinc it ll be cooler . . . vise vera if thei ar go to build a hous made fora colder weather then thei should us black sinc it absorb more heat than ani other color . the darker the color the more heat .
27160	10	2	2	black thi color black mai effect the insid oft he doghous by make the insid of the doghous warmer . i sai thi becaus in the experi with the lid color the black lid made the insid of the jar warmer than all of the other jar . so id pick the color black if you live ina cold climat becaus the black color will absorb the the light and make the dog warmer .
27161	10	1	1	white white becaus white ha the least heat drawn to it then all the other color so your dog would be wai cooler and in better shape ina white doghous then ani other .
27162	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai should work just fine becaus it a littl warm but not to hot and dog like it a littl warm so it would be perfect for your dog
27163	10	1	1	white the color will keep the doghous more cold in the summer .
27164	10	2	2	white it wont be as hot as the other paint would let heat in it show that white wa cooler than the other in there experi of lid color heat up under a lamp
27165	10	1	2	light grai the color of the do hous should be light grai becaus if the doghous is black it go be veri hot insid the dog hous in the summer and light grai would bean ok temperatur an averag of 45 deg c for the summer and a winter and everi other season
27166	10	1	1	white white would make the doghous less hot on as funni dai make it a place where the dog can cool down .
27167	10	2	2	white if brandi and jerri paint the doghous white than the insid of the doghous will stai cooler than if thei paint it black or grai . the averag temperatur for white wa 42 deg c while the averag temperatur for black wa 53 deg c . the differ of the two wa 11 deg c so thi prove that white would beth best color to choos .
27168	10	2	2	white it will keep the doghous the coolest averag e for white wa 42 deg c which would keep the dog from overh .
27169	10	2	2	white if the color is white it will be more cooler than a black doghous becaus black doghous get hotter and faster than white doghous . if it wa white it would stai around 40 deg instead of 44 deg 48 deg and 55 deg .
27170	10	0	0	white the color of the doghous is white becaus it bring out the color of the dog if it black brown .
27171	10	0	0	white that will affect the doghous becaus that wai there wont be to much pressur in the doghous . then the dog will be comfort
27172	10	1	1	white it would make it cooler on the insid
27173	10	2	2	white if the doghous is paint white then it will keep the insid of the doghous colder . in the experi black paint made the air temperatur insid the jar have an averag of 53 deg c and the white paint had an averag air temperatur insid the jar of 42 deg c .
27174	10	1	1	dark grai i would go with dark grai so that wai it doesn t attract lot of heat . but just enough heat so that wai it stai warm insid but not realli warm .
27175	10	1	1	black i chose black becaus the dog might want to stai outsid anywai dure the summer and lai in the shade or run through water sprinkler and in the winter the doghous would stai warm enough for the dog to sleep comfort insid the energi from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghous .
27176	10	1	1	dark grai i choos bark grai becaus it the best color fora doghous becaus it not to hot and not to cold for the dog and the averag is if you choos black than ill be to hot and if you choos whit it be to cold .
27177	10	1	1	black the black lid will attract more heat to the dog hous .
27178	10	1	1	white becaus that color stai the coolest on the jar
27179	10	2	2	dark grai the color will keep the doghous warm but not to warm . the reason i know thi is becaus in the exit lament hot lamp the dark grai lid allow the temperatur to rise an averag of 48 degre . which wa warmer than the 45 and 42 degre averag of the light grai and white but cooler than the averag of the black lid which wa 53 deg c
27180	10	1	1	dark grai the dark grei will make it so it isnt to hotter in the dog hous or 2 cold in the dog hous .
27181	10	2	2	white the lighter the color the cooler the dog will be . when the lid color wa at it darkest black the averag temperatur wa 53 degre calcium . when the lid color wa at it lightest white the averag temperatur wa 42 degre calcium . if brandi and jerri want to keep their dog cool thei should us white paint .
27182	10	1	1	white caus for each trail and averag . it is the lowest featur .
27183	10	1	1	black i chose black becaus it wa the color that kept the jar the hottest degre c deg .
27184	10	0	0	white the color will attract so much heat
27185	10	2	1	black the darker a color is the more heat it take in with the doghous paint black it will absorb more heat rather than if it wa paint white which reflect heat . in the experi when the glass jar had the black lid the temperatur wa 11 deg higher than when the jar had the white lid thi prove that darker color absorb more heat and that brighter color reflect more heat .
27186	10	1	1	light grai the color light grai will beth best choic becaus on averag the air temperatur stai at an averag of 45 deg c . so from the data you can tell that the color try to accumul to the weather . also it wont be too hot or too cold for the dog to stai in .
27187	10	1	1	light grai the color will make sure the insid doesnt get too hot or too cold .
27188	10	1	1	white if the doghous is white then it will be cooler in the doghous for the dog .
27189	10	0	0	black i will keep the dog warmer at night and dure winter when it cold .
27190	10	1	1	white it should be white so that on sunni dai the dog will have a slightli colder doghous than if it wa a darker color .
27191	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai will effect the doghous temperatur becaus the air in the doghous will stai the same all the time .
27192	10	1	1	black it would keep the doghous warm becaus darker color absorb more energi
27193	10	0	0	dark grai becaus he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep .
27194	10	1	1	dark grai thi color is not to cold or to hot it is around normal temperatur . after 10 minut it should be around the same temperatur and if the growth in temperatur continu it could get warm on cool dai
27195	10	1	1	black the color black will affect the insid of the doghous by the outsid where the sun hit will affect the in side by make it hot .
27196	10	1	1	white keep the doghous cool and doe not over heat
27197	10	0	0	dark grai thi color can affect the doghous by keep an even temperatur year round so the doghous wont get to hot or too cold for the dog . the dark grai lid kept the same temperatur the entir test give me a conclus that the dark grai color give an even temperatur .
27198	10	2	2	white the paint color that would be best for the doghous is white . white is the best color to us becaus it would keep the insid of the doghous cool dure the dai so that wai the dog insid of the doghous doesnt get overh . i know that white would keep the insid of the doghous at the lowest temperatur becaus of what the data tabl show which is that the color white averag temperatur from be under the lamp for ten minut wa 42 deg c which wa the lowest averag temperatur while the color black averag temperatur wa 53 deg c which wa the highest temperatur which would caus the doghous to get extrem hot dure the dai and that would be bad for the dog . so that is why white would beth best paint color for the doghous .
27199	10	2	2	dark grai i think that if you choos a color to dark then it might make the dog realli hot so i would choos dark grai becaus it wont veri hot or veri cold . dark grai ha trial that ar 48 deg c which is hot . howev it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperatur of 54 deg and it also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperatur of 41 deg . so dark grai would be a good color fora doghous .
27200	10	2	2	white if thei were to paint the doghous then thei would want to us white becaus that is the on with the less temp true averag temperatur wa 42 deg c for white unlik the black were that is the hottest on there is averag temperatur wa 53 deg c . if thei want cool for the doghous then us the white .
27201	10	0	0	black black will affect the doghous becaus black fade when it in the sun . the color will chang lighter .
27202	10	0	0	white becaus the white will not attract that much heat like the other color .
27203	10	2	2	white becaus white doe not absorb as much heat as black the doghous will be cooler . the white lid reach an averag temperatur of 42 degre c as suppos to 53 for the black on .
27204	10	2	1	white in the experi the white lid kept the temperatur in the glass the coolest . so if brandi and jerri paint the doghous white till keep the insid cool for the dog .
27205	10	1	1	black the darker the paint the the greater the increas in air temperatur in the doghous becaus dark color absorb more energi .
27206	10	0	0	light grai differ color affect the doghous color affect the heat in the doghous
27207	10	2	2	black the black color might effect the doghous by increas the temperatur of the hous . in the experi the averag temperatur for the black wa 53 degre calcium . for the lowest color white it wa 42 degre calcium . thi mean that the black wa 11 calcium warmer than the white and prove that the black color doghous would warm up the hous .
27208	10	2	1	white the white color will keep the doghous cool and not hot . i know thi becaus from the data the white lid wa the coldest and the darker the lid wa the hotter the insid of the jar wa .
27209	10	1	1	white if the doghous is white it will be colder in the doghous becaus if the hous is to hot the dog will not want to be in it
27210	10	2	2	white the white will absorb less heat and the doghous will be cooler or less hot . in the experi black which wa the darkest had an averag of degre calcium and the white the lightest color had an averag heat of 42 degre celsiu
27211	10	1	1	white the color white would reflect the sun rai and keep the doghous cool .
27212	10	1	0	light grai light grai becaus the dog will probabl want to be cool and not hot .
27213	10	1	1	white assum that brandi and jerri live ina warm climat a white doghous would beth better choic . thi is becaus white absorb less heat so a white doghous would stai cooler and keep the dog cooler .
27214	10	1	1	black black would beth best color becaus black e tend to absorb heat thermal energi . so the dog hous would be warmer but the rest of the color wouldnt be as good becaus anyth that is light as in the color white it will reflect heat thermal energi .
27215	10	0	0	dark grai i pick dark grei becaus it will be consist 48 deg c i know becaus in the tabl for each trial it wa 48 deg c .
27216	10	2	2	light grai light grai would keep the insid of the doghous from becom to hot and it would still be abett color than white for cold night . thi is true becaus the averag temperatur for the black lid wa 53 deg c the averag temperatur for the dark grai lid wa 48 deg c the averag temperatur for the light grai lid wa 45 deg c and the averag temperatur for the white lid wa 42 deg c
27217	10	2	2	white if you were to build a doghous you wouldnt want it to get to hot so i would choos white . the averag wa 42 deg c sinc it wa the coolest of the jar i think it would be best for the doghous .
27218	10	2	2	white the color white in the experi show that it had the lowest air temperatur . thi color would affect the insid of the doghous by make it more cooler so that the dog wouldnt be so hot in the doghous .
27219	10	0	0	black the color can effect the doghous becaus if the doghous is a dark color and it hot outsid there will be more energi .
27220	10	1	1	white the averag temperatur show that us white paint for the doghous will beth best choic for keep the dog cool .
27221	10	1	1	white white would beth coolest doghous paint color thei could choos becaus it take longer to get realli hot unlik the other color which got hot realli fast .
27222	10	1	1	dark grai the color will effect the doghous becaus if it is black it will be hotter becaus it attract more heat but if it white then it will attract less heat .
27223	10	2	2	white the white will keep the dog cooler in the summer and it is ok for the winter too . the black the dog would overheat becaus the averag is 53 deg c but the white is 42 deg c which is ok for the winter and the summer .
27224	10	1	1	black make it hotter
27225	10	1	1	black caus black is the darkest color which will make absorb the most heat .
27226	10	2	2	white white would be a good color becaus on sunni dai when the hous is be shine on the white will make it cooler rather then black dark grai or light grai . white will be cooler becaus in the hot lamp experi thei test result for all the 4 color abov . and the averag temperatur for white wa 42 deg c light grai wa 45 deg c dark grai wa 48 deg c and black wa 53 deg c . that show that white wa the coldest color while be shine on by light . therefor white would beth best color to choos for the doghous .
27227	10	1	0	light grai light grai becaus when it is sunni out the dog wont be hot becaus black and other dark color attract the sun .
27228	10	1	1	white white would keep the doghous colder then ani other color and dog hate when there hot and realli cold so white is he fret
27229	10	2	2	black brandi and jerri should paint the doghous black if thei want the dog to stai warm becaus black absorb the most heat at an averag of 53 . 25
27230	10	0	0	light grai it would keep the doghous at a good temp . the entir year round .
27231	10	2	2	white the white color will decreas the temperatur in the doghous becaus the averag temperatur for color black wa 53 degre . and the averag temperatur for the color white wa 42 degre . and thu the doghous will be cooler
27232	10	1	1	black well black absorb light so black absorb heat which would keep the dog warmer .
27233	10	2	2	light grai light grai will affect the doghous by keep it a neutral temperatur so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter . in the investig light grai wa the word hottest so it wa on of the middl color so it would stai neutral .
27234	10	0	0	white becaus if you have a doghous and you paint it a white it will be alight grei insid the doghous and so from that the doghous will be a nice shade of white with alight coat of grei on the insid of the doghous and if the doghous is a squar their will be a perfect color on the dog hous .
27235	10	1	0	white white . becaus the black attract light so then the doghous would heat up . th dark grai is also like the black sot hat wont work either . the last decis wa light grai or white so i pick white becaus that color doesnt attract light .
27236	10	1	1	light grai brandi and jerri should us light grai so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter .
27237	10	2	2	white if the doghous is paint white the air temperatur will be lower than light grai dark grai or black . the white lid jar had an averag temperatur of 42 deg c . the light grai lid had ana averag temperatur of 45 deg c . the dark grai lid had an averag temperatur of 48 deg c . and the black lid had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . therefor white will help make the insid of the doghous cooler .
27238	10	2	2	white if the color is a dark color then the temperatur will increas more than if the color is a lighter shade . white wa the color that affect the temperatur the least in the experi and that would beth best color for the doghous temperatur .
27239	10	1	1	white becaus white it absorb less energi there for cooler air temperatur
27240	10	0	0	dark grai it might affect the doghous a littl . i choos dark grai becaus it averag .
27241	10	2	2	white it will beth coolest on at 42 deg c and dog have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghous
27242	10	1	1	light grai the light grai is the best becaus it will absorb the heat from the sun but wont get to hot .
27243	10	0	0	white thi color will affect the doghous becaus the color white will allow more air to be in the doghous at onc .
27244	10	2	2	white i chose white becaus from the result of the experi white had the lowest averag temperatur of 42 deg c which mean that the insid of the doghous would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shine on it all dai .
27245	10	2	2	light grai thi color might affect the doghous becaus in the summer when it realli hot the light grei will not get too hot and the hous is cooler and not as stuffi for the dog to sleep in versu the black it would be immens humid and stuffi in there . also the light grei is good for the dog well becaus dure the wintertim the temperatur will be realli cold but it would be dark enough to keep warm . so in conclus light grei is the best becaus it keep cool in the summer and it keep warm in the winter . some evid is that in the experi the averag for the light grei wa 45 deg c and the averag for the black wa 53 deg c . the light grai kept cool while the black did not . so dure the summer the dog would die of heatstrok if thei had a black hous . if thei had alight grei hous thei would have a nice cool hous to loung in over the summer and it is a good wai to keep warm dure the winter as well black is more of a winter color to keep warm dure the winter .
27246	10	1	1	black it will make the doghous realli warm insid becaus the darker the color the more it absorb energi .
27247	10	1	1	white white color will give back the sunlight it make the doghous will not get too much hot .
27248	10	1	1	white the color white is a combin of all of the known color and by be that combin absorb less heat while project the combin color that it produc .
27249	10	2	2	white the color white would be a good color fora doghous becaus it heat up the air in it the least . in the experi the color white onli heat up the air in the jar to an averag of 42 deg c compar to the color black which heat up the air in the jar to an averag of 53 deg c .
27250	10	1	1	white it would reflect the most sunlight so the insid temperatur would be cooler than if you were to us ani of the other c color
27251	10	1	1	white thi color might affect the doghous becaus the lighter the color the cooler the doghous will be .
27252	10	1	1	dark grai if thei choos dark grai as the color for the doghous the temperatur of doghous would be neither too hot or too cold for the dog . i chose dark grai becaus black would be too hot for dog becaus thei have fur but white would be too cold becaus even thought he dog have fur if the temperatur is cold the will get cold . so it think dark grai is the best color to choos .
27253	10	0	0	white white would beth best color becaus it reflect the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the doghous .
27254	10	2	2	dark grai it will be warm insid the doghous but not too warm . the black lid made the air in the the jar veri warm . it thought it might be too hot for the dog .
27255	10	1	1	white the white wa the coldest and most dog have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27256	10	1	1	dark grai it will not be to hot or to cold
27257	10	2	2	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus black is the darkest color and from the previou experi it show that darker color absorb more heat . as for white is would get the least amount of heat . main reason i chose dark grai wa becaus from my experi dog tend to be c old so it will be warm but not too hot .
27258	10	2	2	white white would beth best color fora doghous becaus it would not absorb as much energi as the other color and therefor a white doghous would not be as hot insid as black or grai on . the result from the experi show that the air in the jar with a black lid wa 11 degre c hotter than the jar with a white lid and the same would appli to a doghous .
27259	10	1	1	light grai well if you paint the doghous light grai it will keep the dog warm at night but not to warm were it overh .
27260	10	1	1	black becaus black color get worm faster then other color and get hit black get the temperatur 54 the other color get less then that
27261	10	1	1	white if thei us the white color than the dog hous would be cooler becaus brighter color reflect the sun and in the end it would be cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier . also the white color would look good
27262	10	2	2	black brandi and jerri should paint their doghous black . he will be warm insid the black doghous becaus the averag temperatur of the black lid wa 53 deg c . in the jar with the white lid the averag temperatur wa 42 deg c . it will be 11 deg c warmer in the black doghous than the white on . that is the case becaus black attract more sunlight and white repel sunlight .
27263	10	1	2	white thi color will make the insid of the dog hous cooler accord to the data given by brandi and jerri s experi .
27264	10	2	1	dark grai brandi and jerri should paint their doghous dark grai becaus dark grai doesnt ge to hot and isnt to cold . in the summer than the doghous will not get to warm yet it will not get to cold in the winter becaus it doe attract some sunlight to keep it at an averag of 48 deg c . that wai their dog can alwai enjoi it doghous no matter what the temperatur is outsid .
27265	10	2	1	dark grai the darker the color the warmer it is insid . and if it wa black it would be to hot and white or light grai would get to cold .
27266	10	1	1	black make the doghous warmer
27267	10	2	2	white white would be best becaus it reflect more energi the tabl show that the averag temp . after three trial for the white lid wa 42 degre calcium which is 11 degre cooler than the highest averag 52 degre calcium or the black lid .
27268	10	0	0	black the darker color absorb more heat so it would bi a good doghous
27269	10	1	1	white it would make the doghous cooler becaus it wouldnt attract as much heat . thi is becaus the darker the color the more energi it absorb .
27270	10	2	2	white the white paint is the best becaus it wont get as hot as the other color will becaus the highest temp wa 43 deg c and the lowest wa 41 deg c so white is the best becaus it stai the coldest
27271	10	1	1	black it mai affect the doghous by make it warmer than the dark grei light grei and white paint would . becaus the color black attract heat more than ani other color .
27272	10	0	0	light grai ink
27273	10	1	1	black the color energi sun will be attract to the black paint to make the insid temperatur of the doghous increas .
27274	10	2	2	white if you want the doghous to be cooler then i would pick a white lid becaus the white lid wa an averag of 11 deg c cooler then the black dark grei or light grei
27275	10	2	1	light grai the color of the doghous might affect the insid of the doghous by the temperatur insid . as shown in the data tabl of the experi the data show that the averag temperatur is 45 deg c which when compar to other temperatur it show that it is not lowest or the highest it in the middl .
27276	10	2	2	white i think that white would beth best color to paint the doghous becaus it is the color that reflect the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool dure the summer . thi experi show that the white lid had the lesser temperatur insid of the jar so it is the best color .
27277	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai would be a good color to paint the doghous becaus it not too hot and it not too cold . the averag temperatur would be 48 deg c . just right .
27278	10	1	1	white the doghous will be color in the sun becaus the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got paint black .
27279	10	1	1	white the color white might affect the doghous be caus lighter color reflect light .
27280	10	1	2	light grai i would sai light grai becaus if it wa black and in the summertim it would be wai to hot and if it wa white in the winter it could get to cold so i think light grai is the best becaus it wouldnt be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter .
27281	10	2	1	black i pick black becaus black is a dark color and and darker color attract energi like heat . so that wai the insid oft he doghous will be worm . like for the black lid all the result were 54 and all the other color were 10 deg and less .
27282	10	1	1	light grai the color will affect it by warm up insid the doghous but not make it to hot becaus 48 deg c is realli hot so why not make it less like 45 deg c and 42 deg c and 53 deg c is to cold and too hot so make it warm . . . . . wouldnt u want a warm place to stai instead of be cold while you sleep or sweat out of no were
27283	10	1	1	white it would keep the doghous cooler .
27284	10	2	1	white the color white absorb the least heat out of all the color so the doghous would not get overh insid and stai cool justin case there wa a hot summer dai
27285	10	1	1	white i would pick white becaus with white it stai cooler in the doghous than if were black to be more hotter insid .
27286	10	1	1	black the color will make the doghous warmer decreas the need for auxiliari equip facilit the increas conduct of heat energi from the contain atmospher between the doghous wall to the dog thu facilit the dog surviv while maxim cost effici . therefor the doghous should be black . quid eat demonstr
27287	10	2	2	dark grai thi color would keep the temperatur just right . it wouldnt be too hot or to too cold . the averag deg c wa 48 deg c the lowest averag wa 42 deg c and the highest averag wa 53 deg c .
27288	10	1	1	white choos white for the color of the doghous will keep the insid of the doghous cooler becaus darker color absorb more energi .
27289	10	1	1	white the darker the paint the more heat insid the room so you want the lightest color object
27290	10	1	1	black it will make it so that the dog will be warmer at winter .
27291	10	2	2	light grai i pick light grai becaus after 3 trial of 24 deg c for 10 minut it had an averag of 45 which mean that the temperatur remain not to hot and not to cold .
27292	10	0	1	light grai black becaus it would get to hot for the dog and white becaus it could also get to cold
27293	10	1	1	light grai i think light grai becaus from the data that wa the color that wa almost in the middl so that the doghous wouldn t get too heat in the summer or spring and it wouldnt get too cold in the winter or fall .
27294	10	0	0	do thei want the doghous to be warmer or cooler if thei want to have the doghous warm all year choos black paint . if thei want the doghous cooler all year then chose white paint . if thei want the doghous to be lukewarm chose grai paint . if thei want it to be medium cold chose light grai paint . not eno info to tell what you ar ask for
27295	10	1	1	white black could caus the insid of the doghous to heat up quickli becaus the color black heat up faster then most other color .
27296	10	2	2	white white will keep the doghous cool on a hot summer dai more than a darker color such as black . white wa on averag 11 deg c cooler than black .
27297	10	1	1	black sinc dark color captur more heat us black for color to help keep doghous warm .
27298	10	2	2	light grai the best paint color to paint a doghous base on the result is light grai . i said light grai becaus it wa averag 45 deg c . it is not too hot and not too cold . if you paint the dog hous light grai it would keep the dog warm but not too warm . the black lid wa averag 53 deg c . it got hotter becaus the color wa darker . the dark grai wa averag 48 deg c . it wa warm but not as warm as the black becaus the color wa not as dark . the light grai wa averag 45 deg c . it got cooler becaus the lid color wa lighter . the white lid averag 4 2 deg c becaus it wa the lightest and dark color absorb more heat .
27299	10	2	2	white white might affect the doghous becaus it will not absorb as much heat as ani of the other color do . black absorb an averag of 53 and white wa onli 42 .
27300	10	1	1	black the color might affect by sinc it is black it will absorb more light energi which then make the temp futur higher so the insid will be warmer hotter .
27301	10	1	1	white the color white will keep the doghous cool under sunlight becaus in the experi the white color reflect sunlight not absorb it . so the doghous will be cooler
27302	10	1	0	white if it is a lighter color then the doghous won t get as hot as it would if you paint it a darker color .
27303	10	2	2	white thi color might effect the doghous becaus white had the lowest temperatur from all the color . in averag 42 deg c . also it will keep the doghous cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer .
27304	10	1	1	light grai thei should us light grai paint becaus the black would attract too much heat . the darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid . the white paint would be too light and in the winter wouldnt attract as much heat as need .
27305	10	2	2	light grai the color light grei will not absorb too much heat in the summer to keep the dog cool but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm . in the experi the color light grei had a temperatur that wa 21 deg higher than the start temperatur of 24 deg but did not increas too much like the dark grei and black which rose 24 deg and 30 deg from the origin temperatur of 24 deg .
27306	10	2	2	white white would beth best color becaus it had the lowest air temperatur with 42 deg c . thi would keep the insid of the doghous air temperatur cooler on hot dai than a darker color would .
27307	10	1	1	light grai for the bog hous not to be to cold or hot .
27308	10	2	2	black black wa the highest temperatur when under the lamp so if brandi and jerri want a warm doghous thei would choos black becaus black had an averag of 53 deg c instead of other averag like 48 deg c 45 deg c and 42 deg c
27309	10	1	1	white i think that if you us a white paint then the doghous will be nice a cool becaus if you us black the dog would get hot so that why you should us white .
27310	10	0	1	dark grai dure the summer the doghous temp . would be 48 deg . thi would keep it cool . dure the winter the darker color will help keep the heat insid the doghous .
27311	10	1	1	black black attract more heat
27312	10	1	1	black the black paint will trap more heat insid . it will be hotter in the doghous than if brandi and jerri us dark grei light grei or white .
27313	10	2	2	dark grai the dark grai color is fine begun it not to dark and it not too bright . dark gari had a 48 deg c aug and the darkest is black which had a 53 deg c aug also the brightest which is white had a 42 deg c aug
27314	10	1	1	black it would make the doghous warm due to the dark color .
27315	10	1	1	black the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfort
27316	10	2	2	white white is the best color to paint the doghous becaus base on the experi dark color absurd heat and light color dont . the hottest air temperatur in the jar experi 53 deg c wa from the jar with the black lid and the jar with the coolest air temperatur 42 deg c wa from the jar with the white lid prove that light color dont absorb heat and dark color do .
27317	10	2	1	white paint the doghous white would ensur that the dog doesnt get too hot while it insid . white would keep the insid of the doghous cooler than ani other color . i know thi becaus in the experi the averag temperatur for the white lid jar wa less than ani other color lid .
27318	10	1	1	white the color might affect the doghous by take in less energi caus the insid of the doghous to be cooler .
27319	10	2	2	white by paint the doghous white it would make the insid of the doghous cooler . thi is proven becaus in each trial white had the lowest temperatur . for exampl in the experi white averag temper wa 42 deg compar to black averag which wa 53 deg a huge differ
27320	10	2	2	white i chose white becaus white reflect the sun energi so it would stai cooler in the doghous . the data that brandi and jerri got show that white kept the temperatur about 11 deg c cooler than the black lid
27321	10	1	1	black it will make it warmer for the dog insid be hous it absorb more energi .
27322	10	2	2	light grai i think that light grai will look nice on the outsid of the doghous and it will keep the dog veri nice and cool becaus on the data it show that light grai wa the second coolest color lid .
27323	10	2	1	white the color white will affect the insid of the doghous becaus in the lid vs . air temperatur insid glass jar tabl it show that the color white doesnt heat up as much as the other color . the color white reflect the light make it stai cool which is what you want fora doghous .
27324	10	1	1	black i think the color black will make the insid of the doghous warm becaus it is a dark color .
27325	10	2	2	white thei might us white becaus it doesnt get hot as fast as the other color do . in the data tabl it show that the first trail wa 42 deg c the second trial wa 43 deg c the third wa 41 deg c and the fourth wa 42 deg c . for all the other color the trial got higher than 43 deg c therefor the white would be best fora doghous becaus it doesnt get as hot .
27326	10	1	1	light grai it will make the long hous in between hot and cold
27327	10	1	1	white white attract less heat so the dog will no be harm on veri hot dai .
27328	10	1	0	white to design the dog hous i think that the painter should you us white paint becaus sunlight absorb into darker c color becaus thei cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark color just continu to absorb all the light .
27329	10	0	0	black it will make the insid of the doghous cold or warm .
27330	10	2	1	white the color white would beth best to paint the doghous becaus it will be kept cooler than black which the averag wa 53 degre calcium dark grai which the averag wa 48 degre calcium high grai which the averag wa 45 degre calcium and the white averag wa 42 degre celsiu . black absorb the most heat while white reflect .
27331	10	2	2	white thi color would make the doghous 11 deg c cooler than than if it wa a black color . so the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperatur in the hous . in brandi and jerri s experi the white lid wa the coldest and thei said dark color absorb more heat so white would bean appropri color .
27332	10	1	1	light grai light grai might affect the doghous by have the averag temperatur of 45 deg c so if it is cold outsid it wont freez the dog or if it too hot outsid it wont make the dog too hot . black had the highest averag of 53 deg c dark grai had the averag of 48 deg c and white had the lowest averag of 42 deg c . the light grai is just the right temperatur for the doghous of 45 deg c .
27333	10	2	2	light grai thi color might bring the insid of the doghous to a comfort temperatur . accord to the result of the experi the color were in thi order from the highest to lowest temperatur black dark grai light grai white . dog do not normal enjoi hot stuffi environ . thei pant uncontrol when thei ar overh and get veri uncomfort . thi light grai color will allow the dog not to get uncomfort overh but will also not allow him her to reach an uncomfort cool bodi temperatur as white wa result in the coldest temperatur accord to the experi result .
27334	10	0	0	white i think that white is a good color becaus heat will not be attract as fast and white is a realli nice color .
27335	10	1	0	black thi color would keep the doghous warm dure the night and cold dai and if it is a hot dai then the dog will be outsid anywai
27336	10	2	2	black black will keep the insid of the doghous the warmest becaus it will absorb the most heat . in the lab black had an averag of 53 deg c and white had an averag of 42 deg c .
27337	10	1	1	black black is a darker color so there forth it attract heat which would caus th temp after togo up
27338	10	1	1	dark grai well the dark grai would make it warmer but not to warm . amp thei temperatur would stai aton degre . so it would be 48 deg in there .
27339	10	0	0	white it would reflect most heat becaus it absorb as much energi as darker color
27340	10	2	2	black black becaus the black had the highest number the whole experi and it stai the warmest out of all of the other c color
27341	10	2	2	white color the doghous white will give an effect by not make it hot like other color . in the experi thei found out that the white lid had the lowest temperatur of 42 deg . the black lid wa 53 deg the dark grai wa 48 deg and lastli the light grai wa 45 deg . therefor we can conclud that the white attract the least sunlight which will affect the temperatur of the insid less .
27342	10	1	0	light grai light grai becaus when the dog is sleep in the doghous and it run he will get cold becaus it is white sot hei for light grai will keep it warm and cool at the same time for those winter dai and the cold dai with ran
27343	10	1	1	black the sun will be attract to black and it will make the doghous realli hot
27344	10	0	1	white darker color absorb heat from light so lighter color reflect it .
27345	10	0	0	light grai it will wear .
27346	10	2	2	white white becaus it kept the insid of the jar the coolest so the dog wouldnt get to hot in the summer . the insid oft he b jar with the black lid had an averag of 53 deg c and the jar with the white lid onli had an averag of 42 deg c
27347	10	0	0	black the color might effect the insid becaus the color of the wood .
27348	10	2	2	white the color white will ensur that the temperatur insid the doghous will stai much cooler than the color black dark grai and light grai becaus lighter color dont absorb as much heat energi as darker color do . for exampl the insid of the jar with the black color lid had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c while the insid temperatur of ajar with a white lid had an averag temperatur of onli 42 deg c . the insid of the jar with the white lid wa 11 deg c less than the jar did with the black lid .
27349	10	1	1	dark grai it will be warm in the doghous for the winter but not to hot for the dog in the summer .
27350	10	0	0	black becaus it attack energi and that make the paint to come off .
27351	10	1	1	light grai it wouldnt be to hot to live in fora dog but it would be warm and provid heat .
27352	10	1	1	white white becaus white paint absorb heat less than the darker color and you wouldnt want your dog to overheat .
27353	10	1	1	light grai light grai will keep the doghous warm in the winter becaus it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog hous becaus it is alight color ask .
27354	10	0	1	white it would keep the dog cool enough to withstand the heat and have enough warmth for winter sinc dog have fur on their bodi to keep warm .
27355	10	2	2	black have a black doghous might affect the insid of a doghous becaus it would keep it warmer insid becaus darker color such as black absorb heat better . in brandi and jerri s experi the averag temperatur for the black lid jar wa 53 deg c 5 deg c more than the next warmest on dark grai .
27356	10	2	2	black if thei paint the doghous black the condit in the hous would be hot becaus the jar wa the hottest when thei put the black lid on the jar . so that show that black absorb more energi than ani other color .
27357	10	2	2	dark grai the darker the color of the doghous the hotter it will be so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the winter you dont want it to be white . so i pick dark grai becaus in the winter it will still attract sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer it wont attract as much as the black would
27358	10	1	0	it depend on were thei live if it a hot place then a white doghous but if it a cold place then a black doghous to make the doghous a littl warmer and in the middl if it a mixtur .
27359	10	1	1	white white would make the doghous cooler and more pleasant to live in .
27360	10	2	2	dark grai i would choos dark grai becaus in the summer it mai becom warm for the dog so black would be too hot . in the winter black would beth best becaus it is a color that attract more energi so it would increas the temperatur insid . so for an all around the year comfort paint i would choos dark grai becaus it the median between them both .

27362	10	2	2	light grai dark grei would affect the temperatur in the doghous by make it so that the doghous wa neither too hot or too cold . the result of the experi show that the air insid of the jar with the white lid had a averag temperatur of about 42 deg c . in the winter if the doghous wa paint white it would get to cold becaus the experi show that white doe not retain heat well . black wa the color that retain the most heat in the experi with an averag temperatur of 53 deg c . howev even though accord to the experi the doghous would be warm in the winter if the doghous wa paint black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool . the experi show that the air insid of the jar with the light grei lid wa warmer than the jar with the white lid but onli by 3 deg c therefor the doghous should be paint dark grei becaus in the experi the jar with the dark grei lid is 5 deg c cooler than the jar with the black lid . the dark grei would allow the doghous to remain cool in the summer but remain warm in the winter .
27363	10	0	0	light grai it will let the energi go in and out . . .
27364	10	0	0	black becaus that wai the dog wont be hot or cold it would not be cold but it wont be hot lighter .
27365	10	2	2	black black will absorb more heat therefor keep the dog warm throughout the year . the averag temperatur insid the jar with a black lid wa 53 degre calcium while all the other color had an averag of 48 degre celsiu or lower .
27366	10	2	1	dark grai dark grai would heat up the air fora dog to a comfort temperatur and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
27367	10	1	1	black becaus the darker the color the sunlight it attract becaus of the solar energi .
27368	10	2	2	black the color black will keep the doghous warm in the winter . the color black absorb heat better than the other color . the experi result show that black is better becaus in trial temperatur wa 54 deg c and the coldest for black wa 52 deg c . the least warmest wa the color white . the highest temperatur wa 43 deg c . the lowest wa 41 deg c . i chose black becaus it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter . white would not be as warm as black is .
27369	10	1	1	dark grai by paint he doghous the color dark grei might affect the doghous by make it warmer on cold night but not to hot like the black color will make it . i think thi becaus on the result chart the black is a higher temp . than the dark grei and the dark grei also alwai stai a consist temp . in conclus i think thei should paint the doghous grei becaus insid it it will neither be to hot nor to cold .
27370	10	2	2	white the white paint would make the insid of the doghous coolest becaus accord to the experi the averag of each color ar black 53 dark grai 48 light grai 45 and white 42 .
27371	10	2	1	white white would make a good color fora doghous becaus it a rather remain at a rather cool temperatur not too hot for the poor dog as seen on lid color vs . air temperatur for each lid color tabl where it show the averag of the white lid temperatur wa 42 deg c
27372	10	2	2	white the darker color absorb more energi so if you pick black then the temperatur would increas in the air for exampl in the experi the temperatur went to 54 deg . and for the white lid it onli went up to 41 deg that why paint the doghous white is better choic becaus it wont get so hot in the doghous .
27373	10	1	1	white it will let it be less hotter .
27374	10	2	2	white a white color doghous will make the air temperatur warmer in warm temperatur but the light color will not make the temperatur go up a lot . with the black lid color the temperatur of the air insid the jar wa an averag of 53 deg after ten minut . the white jar wa and averag of 42 deg after ten minut . sinc both jar start at 24 deg the temperatur of the black jar increas 29 deg while the temperatur of the white onli increas 18 deg . the darker the color of someth the more heat the object absorb . that mean that the white doghous will beth coolest doghous even though that doghous will warm up as well .
27375	10	1	1	dark grai i would sai dark grai becaus when the sun come out you dont want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark grai would work perfectli in my opinion .
27376	10	2	2	white the doghous would have a cooler temperatur than on paint in grai or black becaus the averag temperatur insid a white doghous wa 42 deg while the averag temperatur of the black dark grai and light grai doghous were 53 deg 48 deg and 45 deg respect .
27377	10	1	1	black it willi hotter come it hot
27378	10	2	2	white white had the lowest temperatur so the doghous wont get extrem hot .
27379	10	1	1	light grai it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus black absorb the most heat .
27380	10	1	1	white brandi and jerri should paint their doghous white . thi is becaus in the summer when the temperatur outsid get hotter the insid of the doghous will be cooler for the dog . that is becaus darker color absorb more light ad heat energi .
27381	10	0	0	dark grai the dark grai color might affect the doghous by keep the doghous the same temperatur throughout the year which is not too cool but not too hot 48 deg . i know thi becaus on the data tabl it show that throughout all the trial the dark grai wa the color that kept the temperatur insid the jar stai the same .
27382	10	2	2	white the white paint would beth best choic fora color of a doghous becaus after 10 minut of have a white lid the air temperatur insid the jar wa the lowest . it seem that the lighter the color the lower averag temperatur the air insid the jar wa after 10 minut . thi would beth best color fora doghous becaus if you would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertim have a white paint doghous would stai much cooler on the insid that if there wa a black paint instead .
27383	10	2	2	white paint the doghous white will rais the temperatur onli slightli while paint the doghous a darker color will rais the temperatur significantli . in the lid color vs . air temperatur insid glass jar data tabl the temperatur insid the jar with the white lid rais an averag of 18 deg c from the start temperatur after 10 minut . the temperatur insid the jar with the black color lid rais an averag of 29 deg c from the start temperatur after 10 minut . if brandi and jerri want the temperatur in the doghous to be cool then thei would paint the doghous white . if thei want the temperatur to be warm thei would paint the doghous black . i would paint the doghous white .
27384	10	0	0	black more dog like black
27385	10	1	1	white if thei were to us white the doghous would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hangout and causeless damag or issu to the dog
27386	10	1	1	light grai the light grai so it not to hot and not to c old
27387	10	1	1	light grai i would choos dark grai becaus on a hot dai the dog can stai nice and cool and on a cold dai the color is still abl to absorb some heat . the experi prove that darker color absorb more heat than lighter so the dark grai color would beth best . also in the trial the averag temp of the jar is 48 deg c so the dog would be nice and warm in the hous .
27388	10	2	2	white the color white might affect the doghous by be cooler insid than the darker color becaus white ob sore less heat than dark color . that why in brandi and jerri slid experi white lid wa the coolest of the darker color .
27389	10	2	2	white i choos white becaus white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so insid the doghous will be more c color . i know thi becaus in the investig it said white had 42 deg c which is the lowest while the black had 54 deg c which is the highest .
27390	10	2	2	white the lighter color would help keep the doghous cooler insid . for exampl the jar with the white color lid wa cooler 42 deg than the black lid 53 deg
27391	10	0	0	light grai becaus it made a mild temperatur in the jar
27392	10	1	1	white how thi color might affect the doghous is when a color is lighter like the color white that color doesnt absorb al of of heat like the color black . so when it go to be realli hot outsid insid the doghous it will be cool .
27393	10	1	1	light grai thi would absorb more thermal energi while still keep cool becaus of the light of the grai .
27394	10	1	1	black black will affect the doghous becaus it will make the insid hot .
27395	10	1	1	light grai the light grai would keep the doghous at a more even temp becaus it both alight and dark color so it would attract the right amount of sunlight and repel just the right amount of sunlight .
27396	10	0	0	white the doghous should be white becaus it ha the warmest or coolest temperatur on the averag from the tabl . it will be warmer or colder than the other color so the dog live in the doghous wont be hot or cold .
27397	10	1	1	dark grai the color will affect the doghous by not make it to cold and not make it to warm .
27398	10	1	1	white i would make the doghous white becaus white dose not attract a lot of heat so the dog would not be so hot . 916
27399	10	1	1	light grai light grei would be a great color to us on a doghous becaus the color would not absorb a lot of heat and and it would not be to cold becaus grei is still a dark color that could absorb heat when need .
27400	10	2	2	white white paint would defiantli beth coolest temperatur for the dog becaus after the 10 minut . under the light it wa the coldest with an averag of two 11 degre colder than the hottest paint color of black the averag of the black paint air wa 53 .
27401	10	1	1	white the insid wont be as hotter .
27402	10	1	2	dark grai the best paint color fora doghous would be dark grai becaus the temperatur insid of the doghous wouldnt be too hot for the dog but it wouldnt be too cold . it wa 48 deg c in the jar with a dark grai lid on averag . that is more suitabl fora doghous than the black lid which wa 53 deg c or the white lid which wa 42 deg c .
27403	10	0	0	dark grai dark grei becaus if you us thi color the dog hous will be about 48 degre and the doghous will not be to cold
27404	10	2	2	dark grai the color dark grai would affect the doghous becaus it would stai at a pretti warm temperatur . thi wai the doghous would be around 48 deg . the doghous would not be too hot 53 dega it would be with the color black but the doghous would not be too cold 42 dega it would be with the color white .
27405	10	0	0	light grai becaus the dog like their home and the dog feel comfort .
27406	10	0	1	light grai light grai wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the term erasur would be just right .
27407	10	2	1	black if you us black paint then it will take in more heat becaus dark color absorb more energi like thei found out in the lab hot lamp the black wa at least 5 deg c hotter then all the other color .
27408	10	1	1	white becaus it absorb less heat and energi
27409	10	2	2	white it will make it so the air insid of the doghous will be cooler so the dog doesnt get to hot . i know thi becaus the data show the averag temperatur for white wa 42 deg c .
27410	10	1	1	white less heat in the doghous so there would be much more comfort for the dog .
27411	10	2	2	black thi color would make the doghous warmer becaus in the experi the darker the color the warmer it will be insid .
27412	10	1	1	white white is best in thi situat as long as it not cold out . white reflect heat thu the huski or labor whatev dog or wolf it is stai cool and collect .
27413	10	1	1	light grai the color absorb enough heat not to be cold in the winter but not to much heat to be hot in the summer .
27414	10	1	1	dark grai it will take in heat in the winter and wont take as much in in the summer as black would .
27415	10	1	1	white white absorb less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27416	10	2	2	light grai light grai is the best color for the dog hous becaus it doesnt make the doghous too hot but it also doesnt make the doghous too cold . the black had an averag temperatur of 53 deg c which is too hot fora dog in the summer . it need to beat a relax temperatur which is 45 deg c for the light grai . if i were to choos the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in . the light grai color would make it so that the dog could be veri comfort in hi littl hous .
27417	10	2	2	black the black paint becaus it will absorb more light energi caus the insid of the doghous to be warmer keep the dog warm at night . the averag temperatur for the black lid wa 53 deg while the white wa 42 deg . the black paint had the highest temperatur out of all color and wa 11 deg higher than the white paint .
27418	10	0	0	white the black color when it get dark dog will have a dark doghous so i just pick white .
27419	10	2	2	black clack absorb more heat energi so it would make the doghous a warmer place for the dog . the averag temperatur for the black lid wa on averag about 8 deg c more than the other color lid . that is why black would be a good choic to paint the doghous with .
27420	10	0	0	white pursu es ll due la ma insid deg glass
27421	10	2	2	black if the color of the doghous wa black then it would make the insid of the doghous warmer insid . in the experi it wa 53 deg c on averag in the jar when the lid wa black and onli 42 deg c on averag when the lid of the jar wa white .
27422	10	1	1	black i think thei should us black becaus it would be warmer for the dog .
27423	10	0	0	white the darker color will absorb heat faster than lighter color .
27424	10	0	0	black black becaus on a warm dai the doghous would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog . and on a cold dai the doghous should beth same temperatur 53 deg c or get a littl colder but not to cold for the anim .
27425	10	2	2	dark grai i chose the dark grai paint color becaus it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light grai paint but cooler in the summer than the black paint would . the experi support thi becaus the dark grei paint in the experi made the insid temperatur an averag of 48 deg c while the highest averag data the black paint wa a temperatur of 53 deg c too hot and the lowest averag data the white paint wa 42 deg c too cold for the dog .
27426	10	0	1	white white would not attract as much heat as the other darker color
27427	10	2	2	light grai light grai would beth best paint color fora doghous . light grai had an averag temp of 45 degre which wouldnt be too cold or too warm fora dog . a white doghous wa 42 degre which might make the dog cold and black and dark grai would make the dog too warm . dark grai averag wa 48 and black averag wa 53 much too warm . therefor light grai would beth best color .
27428	10	0	0	white if the insid of the doghous is white then the doghous wont be so hot becaus of the shade
27429	10	0	1	black if you seeth doghous black then you can see better becaus the color is black you can see black better in the afternoon .
27430	10	2	2	white i would pick white paint to paint the dog hous becaus accord to the experi white wa the color that the insid of the jar would be less hot . accord to brandi and jerri s data the white lid had a temperatur 42 deg c insid the jar and the black lid wa 53 deg c and i dont want my dog to be to hot or suffic in the dog hous .
27431	10	1	1	light grai i would chose light grai becaus in the summer a black hous might overheat the dog howev in the winter a white hous might be too cool . alight grai hous would repel heat in the summer and allow more heat in the winter .
27432	10	1	2	dark grai if brandi and jerri color the doghous white it would not absorb the neat like the color black . therefor it would feel more comfort for the dog when it is hot outsid . the reason why black wa to absorb heat becaus in the data tabl it had higher degre then white which had a lowest degre in temperatur .
27433	10	1	1	light grai the color would keep the doghous at a perfect temperatur not to hot or not to cold
27434	10	1	1	black black would be a good color for the doghous becaus in the dai it would get hotter becaus black absorb heat caus it to be warmer in their at night .
27435	10	2	2	black we can see from thi experi that darker color absorb more heat . know thi inform for the dog to be more warm and comfort insid hi doghous brandi and jerri should paint the hous black .
27436	10	2	2	white assum that the locat of the doghous ha a warm climat the white paint color will be more like to keep the temperatur of the air insid the doghous at a cooler or lower temperatur . thi can be said becaus the white paint color on averag made the air insid the glass jar a temperatur of 42 deg c compar to 53 deg c for black paint 48 deg c for dark grai paint and 45 deg c for light grai paint . it is vital that the doghous maintain a low temperatur so that the dog that stai insid the doghous doesnt overheat .
27437	10	2	2	white thei should us white paint becaus when the sun come out the doghous wont get as much heat absorb . as shown in the tabl the darker lid thei us the hotter the air becam and white is the lightest color us and it had the lowest temperatur .
27438	10	2	2	dark grai the color will effect the doghous by keep it the same temperatur which would be cool in the summer and warm in the winter becaus the trial show that the dark grei paint made the jar the same temperatur for all 3 trial which the averag temperatur wa 48 deg c .
27439	10	2	2	dark grai i think the best color for the doghous is d ark grai becaus it not the hottest color or the coldest which will help the dog stai cool but also warm . it show that in each trial the temp true wa 48 deg c for the dark grai color which mean that the term apertur will stai medium for most the time . also dark grai take in more heat then white by 6 deg c averag .
27440	10	2	2	white it will keep it cooler due to the fact that white doesnt absorb as much heat as dark grai light grai and black . also becaus black averag in deg c wa 53 dark grai averag wa 48 . light grai averag wa 45 and white averag is 42 . leav that white will leav the doghous cooler .
27441	10	1	1	black black would beth best becaus it keep the insid of the doghous the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27442	10	2	2	black black would bean ideal color to pain the doghous becaus of the insul if provid within . out of all the color of white dark grai light grai black and white black had the highest temperatur within the glass jar with and averag of 53 deg c while the lowest temperatur wa with the color of white with an averag of 42 deg c . thu choos black should make the doghous warmer becaus black seem to have a high temperatur than ani other . howev you must also consid where the doghous is be place . if the doghous should be place outdoor black would beth ideal color to keep the dog warm dure cold winter . if place indoor the color mai not matter becaus indoor is usual warm .
27443	10	2	1	white white would beth best color becaus it will be more cooler in the doghous then ani of the color abov . in the data tabl with black paint the averag wa 53 deg c . the white paint the averag wa 42 deg c . so that show that if you go for light color it will reduc the heat insid but if you do want it realli hot then go for the dark color .
27444	10	0	0	black 1 the dog will be feel like fa net . 2 the dog will get thirsti . 3 the dog will breath realli hard .
27445	10	0	0	white the color should keep the insid of the doghous at a reason temperatur . base on the result from the experi the hypothesi wa right about black soak up heat through the black rather than white . so the white paint would work the same by keep the heat under control and not let it all in .
27446	10	0	0	dark grai becaus dark grai color absorb more energi .
27447	10	2	2	white thi color effect the doghous becaus it make it cooler accord to the hot lamp experi . in there experi the white lid wa the coolest .
27448	10	2	2	white the best color to paint the top of the doghous would be white . in the experi on averag the black lid absorb 5 3 deg c dark grai 48 deg c light grai 45 deg c white 42 deg c . the black lid absorb 11 deg more heat than the white lid . by paint the top of the doghous white it decreas the amount of heat get trace within the doghous .
27449	10	0	0	white how white would affect the doghous is that it would get driver more easili that how it would affect the doghous .
27450	10	2	2	light grai in there experi thei found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorb so thei should us alight grei for the doghous becaus it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stai nice and cool insid but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right temperatur .
27451	10	1	1	dark grai black becaus it will get to hot
27452	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it wont make the insid of the doghous to hot becaus the dog alreadi ha a larg coat of fur and dark grai wont overheat the doghous .
27453	10	1	1	white the lighter the color the less heat will be insid the doghous . the darker the color more heat will be insid the doghous
27454	10	1	1	white so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and it not too cold for the winter .
27455	10	0	1	dark grai i chose dark grai becaus where i live it can get fairli cold . the dark grai might offer the dog warmth dure the winter and at night without overh the doghous . and hopefulli in the summer the dog will be abl to runaround and wont have to worri about get to hot in the doghous then . i think your question is too vagu . it realli depend on the climat and dog breed .
27456	10	1	1	white i would choos white becaus i would want my dog to not have all that heat trap up ina littl tini space . that hot air which is absorb through dark color i wouldnt want my dog sit in that . i would want him to be cool so that why i choos the white color as a paint fora doghous .
27457	10	2	2	white base on the data white had the lowest temperatur averag of 42 while other have an averag of 45 48 and 53 . it all depend on the dog you ar get if it fur is dark better to get light color so it can be cooler .
27458	10	1	1	black thi color would keep the insid of the dog hous warm becaus dark color attract heat from the son .
27459	10	1	1	white the color white doe not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghous wont get as hot .
27460	10	1	1	light grai it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27461	10	2	1	white white ha less heat absorpt . if the sun is out and it is hot the doghous will still be cool insid . white ha at temperatur in the low 40 s for sit under a lamp for 10 minut . light grai ha temperatur in the mid 40 s . dark grai is high 40 s . and black is low to mid 50 s .
27462	10	0	0	black thei could us black becaus black keep heat better than the other color so the dont want there dog to get cold sob lack is the most effect color .
27463	10	1	1	dark grai the temperatur will stai the same in the cold and hot weather . the temperatur will never be too hot or too cold .
27464	10	2	2	white white would affect the doghous becaus accord to the result of the experi trial 1 sai that us black made the temperatur insid 54 deg dark grai made it 48 deg light grai made it 44 deg and white made it 42 deg . thei should choos white becaus it would keep the doghous the coolest that wai the dog doesnt overheat .
27465	10	2	2	white the white lid had the lowest temperatur and the black lid had the highest temperatur so thei would us white so when the temperatur outsid is hot the insid of the doghous wont get hot becaus the white paint will deflect the heat .
27466	10	2	2	white white becaus the data show the temperatur of each of the lid and from the data tabl it show that black 53degr ey wa the highest and white degre wa the lowest . so if thei want a to paint the doghous thei should paint it white do to the temp true of the doghous wont be to hot for the dog to be in .
27467	10	0	1	white thi color could keep the doghous cool in direct sunlight . thi could make it more comfort for the anim .
27468	10	0	0	white i choos white becaus if the doghous is outsid then the white would absorb enough energi to keep the dog warm without overh it .
27469	10	2	2	black the air temperatur insid will be warm and cozi . black is the warmest in the investig for the lamp and color of the lid it got an averag of 53 deg c . the lightest color white got an averag of 42 deg c .
27470	10	1	1	dark grai a dark grai color would absorb more heat then light grai and white make it warmer but not as much as black so it wont get too warm .
27471	10	2	1	black black would keep the doghous warmer dure cold winter becaus it hold more heat than the white or the grai . the averag for the black wa 53 deg c and the white wa 42 deg c . that mean the black hold about 11 degre more of heat .
27472	10	1	1	white with white the temperatur in the doghous would stai nice and cool in the summer
27473	10	2	2	white the color white would affect the doghous by keep it cooler than ani other of the color . i know thi becaus in the experi the white color lid had a chang of temperatur of onli 1 8 degre when the black lid had a chang of temperatur of 29 .
27474	10	1	2	white the doghous will usual be cool insid even on sunni dai becaus the light from the sun will reflect off of the doghous caus the light to not enter it and make the transform into thermal heat energi .
27475	10	2	2	white if the doghous wa white the insid would be cooler becaus in the data of the experi the averag temperatur of white is 42 deg c and black averag is 53 deg c
27476	10	2	2	white that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summertim . i know thi becaus in the experi the black lid had an averag of 53 and white had an averag of 42 so that more than a 10 deg c differ .
27477	10	1	1	light grai light grai becaus it not hot or cold but a littl warmer than white .
27478	10	1	1	black it will keep the doghous warmer becaus the black attract heat
27479	10	1	1	black the color black becaus it would be warm in the doghous . sinc black absorb more heat black would be best to keep the dog warm rather than cold .
27480	10	1	2	white i think the doghous should be white becaus in the experi white didnt get veri hot . the highest temperatur wa 43 deg c and the lowest wa 41 deg c .
27481	10	2	2	dark grai if brandi and jerri us the color dark grai for their doghous that would beth best color becaus it would keep the doghous warm and cool depend on the season . the color dark grai in the jar experi had an averag of 48 deg c . that make the temperatur of the doghous in gener not to hot and not to cool base on the jar experi .
27482	10	2	2	white white will make the doghous cooler than ada rer color such as black becaus in the data tabl it show that the averag temperatur insid the jar with a white lid wa 42 deg c and insid the black lid it wa 53 deg c that is 11 deg c warmer .
27483	10	2	2	black if he chose black the doghous will get more hot air becaus in the stori the black color get more heat becaus it darker
27484	10	2	2	white it would make it cooler in there for the dog becaus white and light color assimil less energi and heat then darker color . for exampl the averag for the black lid wa 53 deg c but the averag for the white lid wa onli 42 deg c . which is a lot less . so i think brandi and jerri should go with paint their doghous white .
27485	10	2	2	white a white doghous will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler insid . i know thi becaus in the experi the black lid got to beth hottest at 54 deg c well white wa the coolest at 42 deg c . white wa also cooler then dark grai at 48 deg c and light grai at 44 deg c . so white would beth coolest for the doghous .
27486	10	1	1	black the doghous if paint black will be warmer becaus the color black attract heat .
27487	10	0	0	light grai the light grei will effect the doghous by make it more notic and plu dog can onli see black white and grei .
27488	10	1	1	light grai it can make it hot but not to hot caus it do not attract as much heat as black or dark grai
27489	10	1	1	black the darker the color the more heat it absorb . have a black doghous would make it warm on the insid
27490	10	2	2	white brandi and jerri predict that the darker the lid color the greater the increas in air temperatur in the glass jar becaus darker color absorb more energi . their hypothesi wa correct . thi is becaus the averag temperatur insid the glass jar with the black lid after three ten minut trial wa 53 degre but the averag temperatur insid the glass jar with the white lid after three ten minut trial wa 42 degre . becaus black wa the darkest color of the lid it a bore the most heat so the air temperatur wa highest and vice versa for the white lid . thu becaus we dont want the doghous to be overh the best color to paint it would be white becaus white would absorb the least heat .
27491	10	2	2	black the color black will affect the doghous by make it a warmer environ for the dog . plu if it is a cold winter the doghous will help to keep the dog warmer . the data tabl show that us the black lid color the air temperatur wa clearli around 12 deg higher then the white lid about 10 deg higher in temperatur than the light grai lid and about 6 deg higher in temperatur than the dark grai lid each trial . the averag temperatur wa 53 deg c for the black lid the averag temperatur for the dark grai lid wa 48 deg c the averag temperatur for the light grai lid wa 45 deg c and the averag temperatur for the white lid wa 42 deg c . it show the black lid absorb more heat to keep the doghous warmer .
27492	10	0	0	black is to dark
27493	10	1	1	white white would beth best color fora doghous becaus accord to thi experi whit absorb the most heat with an averag temperatur of 42 deg c compar to the black paint which had an averag temperatur of 53 . 25 deg c make the doghous a cooler place to live .
27494	10	1	1	black if the doghous is black than the insid will be warmer when there is sun shine on it so the dog will stai warm
27495	10	1	1	light grai light grai would allow the doghous to absorb heat though not as much as black so it would not be incred hot but it would still be warmer than white . also it wouldnt be as cold as the white but would be cooler than the black . so light grei is the perfect color to be not quit hot and not quit cold and just the right temperatur to make the doghous comfort for the dog .
27496	10	1	0	white the color white reflect most of the sun heat while the color black absorb most of the sun heat .
27497	10	2	2	white the best paint color for the doghous would be white . insid of the doghous the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were paint black or grai . the averag temperatur for the black lid wa 53 deg c but for the white lid it wa 42 deg c . the white lid made the air 11 deg cooler than the black lid .
27498	10	0	0	white white caus black make heat wors and so i c hose white becaus everi doghous is white becaus it easier to see in the dark and it comfi and warm .
27499	10	1	1	black the darker the color the greater the increas in the air temperatur in the doghous becaus darker color absorb more energi .
27500	10	1	1	white white will keep the doghous cooler
27501	10	0	0	black black will affect the doghous bui keep heat in
27502	10	0	0	black bring heat in the doghous
27503	10	1	1	white white doesnt attract heat but black dark grai and light grai do so the dog would be kept cool .
27504	10	1	1	dark grai dark grai would keep the temperatur of the doghous constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold .
27505	10	0	0	dark grai dark grai will keep the doghous the same temp in the summer and winter as long as there is light .
27506	10	1	1	white white is the best becaus it is the coolest and would not overheat he dog
27507	10	2	1	light grai if you paint the doghous black then the insid will alwai veri hot . then when the sun is shine on it just like in the lab it sai the the darker the color . the greater the increas in air insid the doghous . so i would not choos black to beth color for the doghous . i would pick light grei becaus it is dark but at the same time it is alight color . when the sun is shine or give heat to the doghous it will be warm but cool at the same time becaus it is alight color and alight color doe not observ as much heat .
27508	10	1	1	light grai if the doghous is light grai then in the winter it will be slightli warmer than the actual temperatur and in the summer it will be slightli cooler than the actual temperatur .
27509	10	1	1	light grai base off the result you would want thi color becaus it doesnt attract to much heat and it wouldnt be to cold at the same time .
27510	10	1	1	light grai i think light grai would beth best becaus it wouldnt be too hot or cold
27511	10	2	2	white the white doghous will not make the dog as hot insid becaus white is averi bright color but black is a dark color so it will get hotter . in the experi when the black cap wa on the t temperatur wa hotter than have the whitecap on .
27512	10	2	2	light grai i choos light grai becaus light grai isnt too light and is not too dark . light grai will caus the doghous to be at a comfort temperatur . if it wa white it would be too cold and if it wa black then it would be too hot . in the experi light grai had an averag temperatur of 45 deg c while white had 42 deg c and black had 53 deg c .
27513	10	1	2	white brandi and jerri should us white paint fort here doghous becaus in the investig the white paint color onli had a 18 deg increas as black paint had a 29 deg increas . the differ he between the two paint temperatur wa 11 deg .
27514	10	2	2	white white would beth best color fora doghous becaus it absorb the least amount of heat . in summer you wouldnt want the doghous to be overh . the white color had an averag of 42 deg c while the black color wa 53 deg c thi is a differ of 11 deg c between the two color .
27515	10	1	1	black the color black would make the hous warmer on the insid .
27516	10	2	2	white i think that white would be a good color becaus in brandi and jerri s experi white gave a cooler temperatur than the other so the doghous could be colder than warmer .
27517	10	1	1	dark grai thi color would allow the hous to collect on heat without it be to hot . sinc grai is lighter then black but not to light .
27518	10	2	2	light grai thi color would affect the doghous by be dark enough to let heat in dure cold season and be light enough to keep heat out dure the summer and on other hot dai . on averag the heat insid the jar with alight grai 45 deg c wa cooler than that of black 53 deg c and dark grai 48 deg c
27519	10	1	1	white so if it is hot outsid and the dog want togo insid the doghous then it will be cooler becaus the color of the doghous is white .
27520	10	1	1	light grai it depend on the dog . if the dog ha medium amount of hair then the best color would probabl be light grai becaus it doesnt absorb that much heat energi . but if the dog wa a hairless on then it would be best togo with black so that wai the dog could get enough heat in the doghous .
27521	10	1	1	dark grai dark grei will make the doghous warm insid but it wont get to hot for the dog . in the jar the air temperatur insid the jar with the dark grei lid stai at 48 . there for in the doghous it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
27522	10	2	2	white white could be a color for the doghous . it wouldnt make the insid of the doghous too hot becaus of how light the color is . also in the experi white had the lowest temperatur out of all four c color . 42 deg c 43 deg c 41 deg c and 42 deg c . wherea the other color black dark grai and light grai all had higher temperatur . the temperatur vari from the highest temperatur which wa 54 deg c the color black . to the lowest temperatur 41 deg c for the color white .
27523	10	2	1	black the color black is go to make the doghous more warm becaus darker color absorb more energi .
27524	10	1	1	black the darker the color is the hotter the doghous would be . the lighter the doghous is the cooler the doghous would be insid
27525	10	0	0	white it will keep the temp . in the 40 deg area c deg and not burn up the dog insid the doghous .
27526	10	2	2	white the color white might affect the doghous becaus the dog wont get too hot in the summer becaus the weather is warmer in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four . white wa onli 42 degre and black wa 53 degre .
27527	10	2	2	light grai choos the light grai for the color of the doghous would be a good color . it wouldnt be to hot or to cold for the dog . dure the experi the black lid produc averi hot temperatur of 53 deg c . the white lid creat a temperatur of 42 deg c . choos the light grai color would be a good medium .
27528	10	2	2	white white might affect the insid of the dog hous becaus it went up onli 20 degre from the start temperatur . i think white is the best paint color to us becaus it had the lowest temperatur and it doesnt absorb a lot of energi .
27529	10	2	2	white white would make the doghous less hot . the data tabl show that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1 2 and 3 .
27530	10	0	0	white becaus dog can onli see black and white so that will affect the doghous
27531	10	2	2	white the color white wouldnt absorb as much energi as the darker color so the doghous wouldnt becom too warm . with a black lid the jar wa an averag temperatur wa 53 deg c after 10 minut . with the white lid the temperatur wa an averag of 42 deg c . thi show that the lighter the color the less heat you will have trampl insid the doghous . someth to warm would not be suitabl fora dog and therefor make white the right color .
27532	10	0	0	light grai light grai how it might affect the doghous is that the light could be so power from the light that the color might get realli hot well the doghous might get realli hot .
27533	10	2	1	light grai i think light grai will beth best for the dog becaus in the summer it will not too warm hot and winter not too cold . sinc the data prove that the darker the object the more it will absorb the energi which gain or lose heat base the color . and sinc the averag data of light grai is about in the middl which wa 45 deg c .
27534	10	2	2	white a white color would keep it cooler becaus accord to the data white ha the lowest averag temperatur of 42 degre calcium while black ha the highest averag temperatur of 53 degre calcium .
27535	10	1	1	light grai base on the data i think light grei would beth best color . i think that becaus it would make the doghous warm for the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer .
27536	10	1	1	light grai alight grai would make the doghous warm but not too cold like when it is rain you dont want to have a white doghous . the averag for the black color lid wa 53 deg c which is too hot and the dark grai wa 48 deg c which is still a littl too hot and the averag for the light grai is 45 deg c and the white wa 42 deg c so you could paint it white if you want it cooler but it realli depend on the dog so if you had a shave or close to shave dog you would mayb even want a dark grai doghous but if you had a dog with a lot of hair you would want a white doghous .
27537	10	1	1	white the white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghous mean it would be great for summer . but if you want the warmer hous in the winter the black doghous should do the trick .
27538	10	0	0	black realli black .
27539	10	2	1	white if you us white paint color to paint a dog hous it would beth best choic to keep the dog cool dure a hot dai . in the experi out of the 4 test lid color white held out to beth e on with the lowest temperatur .
27540	10	1	1	white thi color might affect the doghous becaus sinc white doesnt absorb ani heat the doghous insid will be cool enough for the dog to be in . darker color absorb more energi and sinc white is the lightest color of all the color there will be no energi absorb .
27541	10	0	1	white thi will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer .
27542	10	1	2	dark grai the color might affect the doghous by give the doghous more heat in the insid but also not give to much heat insid the doghous . dark grai will attract at an averag about 48 deg c of heat the black color ha to much heat about 53 deg c and the color white ha to littl of heat at about 42 deg c . so therefor the dark grai would be best for the color of the doghous .
27543	10	2	2	black the more dark the doghous is the hotter it will be in the doghous so if it wa black it would be hot in it like in the experi when the kid wa black it wa 53 degre c and when the lid wa white it wa 42 degre
27544	10	2	2	white the color of the doghous should be white becaus that wai in the summer it wont be to hot for the dog . as shown in the data white is the coolest . the averag fora black lid is 53 deg c . the dark grai lid is 48 deg c the light grai lid is 45 deg c and the white lid is 42 deg c . therefor the white is the coolest and it wont get that hot for the dog .
27545	10	1	1	white with a white doghous the dog will be cool when the weather is warm hot becaus the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter becaus there is not much heat to absorb anywai so it would not matter how dark the paint is .
27546	10	1	1	black the color black would beth best color to paint the doghous becaus you will have a higher temperatur with a darker color it will have a warmer . there will be a higher chanc for the doghous to beat a higher temperatur .
27547	10	1	1	black it will keep it hot becaus black absorb the sun rai faster then a lighter color
27548	10	1	1	white the air temperatur will be lower on averag becaus in the experi white kept the temperatur insid the jar the lowest .
27549	10	1	1	light grai thi color will affect the doghous by heat it but not overh the doghous .
27550	10	1	1	white white becaus white reflect sun and u want it to be cold ina doghous fora dog
27551	10	2	2	dark grai dark grai would be a good color becaus it wouldn t be too cold nor to hot . in the experi the dark grai jar wa in the middl of temperatur not be the coldest like the white or the warmest like black but somewhat in the middl with an averag temp of 48 deg c
27552	10	1	1	white the doghous would stai cooler becaus white doesnt attract the that much heat .
27553	10	2	2	white the color white had the lowest temp at the end of the ex pavement so that mean it will be cooler insid the doghous then it would be with other color
27554	10	1	1	dark grai it would make it cooler in the summer but warmer in the winter becaus the dark color would at rake the heat .
27555	10	2	2	white white would be better for the doghous becaus it doesnt absorb that much energi like black and dark grai did . white onli absorb an averag of 42 deg c where black absorb an averag of 53 deg c .
27556	10	2	2	dark grai dark grai would beth best color for the doghous as it isnt too warm nor too cold . darker color attract more heat than light so dark grai wouldnt be too hot or cold . in an air temperatur experi four color were measur black dark grai light grai and white . the data measur black as 53 deg c dark grai as 48 deg c light grai 45 deg and white 42 deg c . dark grai as you see isnt too warm neither too cold make it the best color for the doghous .
27557	10	2	2	white us white paint would make the doghous colder than if thei us black paint . as wa shown by the tabl the averag temperatur of the jar with a black lid wa 53 deg c while the averag temperatur of the jar with a white lid wa 42 deg c . the jar with the black lid wa 11 deg c warmer than the jar with the white lid . thu us white paint would also make the doghous colder than us black paint and brandi and jerri should us white paint .
27558	10	1	1	white white will make the doghous cooler becaus it reflect the most light
27559	10	2	2	white the black wa 9 deg c warmer then the white color paint . the black paint would make the doghous to warm for the dog . the white paint would be better becaus it would keep the doghous cooler in the summer .
27560	10	2	2	white paint the doghous white will keep the insid cooler then the black paint job by 11 deg c . the averag temperatur for the black lid jar air wa 53 deg c wherea the averag temperatur for the white lid jar air wa an averag of 42 deg c .
27561	10	2	1	white white you beth best color for brandi and jerri s doghous becaus accord to their experi white absorb less energi than darker color . therefor brandi and jerri s dog would be abl to stai cool in warm weather .
27562	10	0	1	dark grai it wont be too hot or too cold in the dog hous .
27563	10	0	0	white bright color reflect the light so the dog will not get so hot .
27564	10	1	1	black the color black would keep the the dog warm .
27565	10	1	1	light grai the color would affect the doghous in thi wai in the heat the dog would stai cool but it not so light that it would be cold for him in the winter . so keep it at alight darker color you have a mixtur of the 2 .
27566	10	2	2	light grai alight grai paint on the doghous might provid some heat in the winter while not make it too hot in the summer . that is shown by the data in the 20 deg c increas in temp . dark grai or black would overheat the doghous dure the summer becaus of the averag increas of 24 deg c for dark grai and 29 deg c for black . a white paint would not provid much heat dure the winter shown by the meager 18 deg c increas . howev on the other hand thi experi isn t close applic . the doghous would not like be made of glass and seal off from outsid air circul . also the sunburn mani differ gase provid a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp in addit to be brighter . the doghous would also like have a thicker roof made of wood and shingl . a note you could have interchang roof on the doghous on of each color and circul them dure the year with white in the summer and black in the winter and the other two scatter between .
27567	10	1	1	white i think it would be white becaus then when it is hot outsid then it would wouldnt be as hot in the doghous then it would be when the doghous is white .
27568	10	2	2	light grai it will affect the doghous by keep it some what cool in the summer becaus the light grai glass jar absorb ana averag of 45 deg celsiu while the black glass jar absorb an averag 5 3 deg celsiu make an 8 deg celsiu differ between the two .
27569	10	2	2	black the color black will be more warmer insid than ani other color abov thu brandi and jerri should paint th dog hous black . accord to the result from the experi the color black had the highest averag air temperatur of 53 . the darker the color the warmer the air temperatur wa in the glass jar becaus darker color absorb more energi .
27570	10	2	2	black the black paint might make the doghous absorb more heat make the doghous warmer . i think thi is how the paint will affect the doghous becaus in the experi result the black paint retain the most heat in the glass jar .
27571	10	0	0	white becaus white dose not attract anyth
27572	10	1	1	white white would be better becaus dure the summer it would be cool with a white doghous and it would be hot and humid with a black doghous
27573	10	1	1	dark grai it will warm the doghous but not get it to warm
27574	10	2	1	light grai light grai would be a littl cool in temp amur e as the black or dark grai on would get to hot and the white on would get a littl cold .
27575	10	1	1	light grai in all season the doghous will stai at a comfort temperatur . in the warmer weather the color wont absorb as much heat keep the doghous cool . dure the colder season the dog will still have a warmer area and with the dog fur he would stai nice and warm .
27576	10	2	2	white the white paint color would be cooler becaus on a sunni hot dai the dog might be realli hot so the dog would just go in hi doghous . the white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat . the for the insid of the doghous would be allot cooler than be in the sun . the experi tell it all the white after onli 10 minut got up to 40 deg c as the other color went up to 45 48 and 53 . the dog would much appreci a cooler place to rest . come to a solut the white paint would beth best to us fora doghous .
27577	10	2	2	black white would keep the doghous the coldest around 40 . if the doghous wa white it would be in the low forti . if the doghous wa light grei it would be in the mid forti . if the doghous wa dark grei it would be high forti . if the doghous wa black it would be in the low fifti . white would reflect the light and not heat up the doghous as much as ani other color .
27578	10	0	0	white it doe not attract as much lite as a darker c color
27579	10	1	1	black becaus black absorb heat more then the other color
27580	10	1	1	white the color white absorb less heat therefor will reduc the impact the sun ha on the temperatur insid the doghous .
27581	10	1	1	black the color black prevent more cold and absorb more thermal energi make it a warmer place for the dog .
27582	10	1	0	light grai light grai might affect the insid of the doghous becaus dark color attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot . but then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold . sot he averag temperatur for light grai is a good temperatur for an live environ .
27583	10	2	2	light grai paint the doghous light grai would keep the doghous cool in the summer but warmer in the winter . i know thi becaus the data tell you that the lighter the color of the glass jar the c color the insid of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t temperatur while be in the glass jar
27584	10	1	1	white white becaus if you live ina hot place the doghous will be less hot becaus white reflect most of the light off of the doghous .
27585	10	1	1	light grai thi color will affect the doghous for the best . the darker color keep in heat but sometim heat isnt alwai good . i found a compromis that can keep heat in and ha a somewhat high air temperatur but wont be to hot for the dog .
27586	10	1	1	light grai i think light grai would work the best becaus if it hot outsid the hous will manag to stai cool insid and in the winter it will manag to stai warm insid .
27587	10	1	0	dark grai if thei paint the doghous dark grai then the doghous would stai warm becaus in trial 1 3 the temperatur stai at 48 deg c .
27588	10	0	1	white the black would affect the doghous becaus the sun is attract to black . so if the sun is beat down on the doghous to long it is possibl that the dog could overheat of get veri sick . someth els could happen to the dog that is sleep in the doghous .
